    <h2>
      CHAPTER I&mdash;FATHER AND SON
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">&ldquo;L</span> IFE is a
      glorious thing,&rdquo; said the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sylvester Lanyon looked at her half in amusement, half in wistfulness.
      There was no doubt whatever of her sincerity. Therein lay the pathetic. To
      reply that the shadow of death and suffering clouded life's glory was too
      obvious a rejoinder. So he smiled and said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We ought to conquer it, make it our own, and live it to the full.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it is to be conquered by us weak wretches, it can't be such a glorious
      thing,&rdquo; he remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But who said we were weak wretches?&rdquo; she retorted. &ldquo;You're not one, and
      I'm not one!&rdquo; She laughed, flushing a little. &ldquo;No, I'm not,&rdquo; she repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      If Sylvester Lanyon had been endowed with the power of graceful words,
      here was a chance for a pretty compliment. It was challenged by the girl's
      self-conscious glance and by the splendid vitality of her youth; for Ella
      Defries usually carried the air of a conqueror with a certain sweet
      insolence. Some such idea passed vaguely through his mind, but, unable to
      express it, he said, shifting his ground lamely,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see I'm getting elderly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You're only five and thirty. My own age to a day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't quite follow,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A woman is always ten years older than a man. You ought to know that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that proves?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That you ought to go into the world and win fame and mix with the
      brilliant men and women in London who can appreciate you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't want to mix with more brilliant men and women than those who are
      under this <i>roof of Woodlands</i>,&rdquo; said Sylvester.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ella flushed again, but this time she drooped her eyes and bent her head
      over her sewing for some time abandoned. A smile played round her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your Aunt Agatha, for instance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, dear soul. The other two.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He rose and filled his pipe from a tobacco jar on the mantel-piece. The
      room, furnished with the solid mahogany and leather of a bygone
      generation, was his father's particular den, where, however, of all rooms
      in the house, he was least likely to find the privacy for which it was set
      apart. Ella, during her periodical visits to Ayresford, calmly monopolised
      it; Sylvester strolled in naturally from his widowed house over the way;
      Miss Agatha Lanyon, although she pretended to cough at the smoke, would
      leave her knitting promiscuously about on chairs and tables, while the
      little grandchild Dorothy spilled the ink with impunity over the Turkey
      carpet.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a silence while Sylvester lit his pipe and settled down again in
      the leathern armchair by the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want no better company than the dear old man's, and yours,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My conversation is not fit for an intellectual man,&rdquo; said Ella, with a
      humility that contrasted with her conquering attitude of a few moments
      before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a very clever girl,&rdquo; said Sylvester.
    </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head with a little air of scorn and threw her sewing on the
      table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no. It pleases my vanity to think so. But what do I know in
      comparison with you? What can I do? You go to a bedside and hold the keys
      of life and death in your hand. To you, all the hidden forces and
      mysteries of nature are every-day commonplaces. Professor Steinthal of
      Vienna, whom I met the other day at Lady Milmo's, told me that, if you
      chose, you could become the greatest bacteriologist in Europe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he say that?&rdquo; asked Sylvester, eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and that is why you ought to go away and live in London and fulfil
      your life gloriously.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A look of amusement came into his grave eyes, and lit for a moment the
      sombreness of a face prematurely careworn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I <i>am</i> going to London,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I sold the practice this
      morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ella rose from her chair impetuously. &ldquo;Why didn't you tell me at once,
      instead of letting me say all these silly things? It is just like a man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You took my apathy so much for granted,&rdquo; he said, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose I am a weak wretch, after all,&rdquo; said Ella.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sylvester put down his pipe and stood by her side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is really all your doing, Ella. This is not the first time you have
      pointed out my way to me. And it won't be the last, will it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a note of pathetic appeal in his tone that made her heart beat a
      little faster. Of all the phases of his manhood that her instinctive
      feminine alertness had caused him to present to her, this one moved her
      the most strongly. An unwonted shy tenderness came into her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is for you to settle that,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her for a moment as if about to speak, but some inward
      conflict seemed to check the words. A man's memories and dead loves rise
      up sometimes and stare at him in sad reproach.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish I had the gift of speech,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you want to say?&rdquo; she asked gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      He smiled whimsically. &ldquo;If I could tell you that, I should have the gift.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll let me see something of you in London, won't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, of course! Whom else should I want to see? Frodsham's practice is a
      large one&mdash;I am buying a share, you know. A specialist generally has
      his hands full. I shall have neither the time nor the desire to go about
      butterflying. Besides, it is only a few people that like me. I'm generally
      looked upon as a 'stick.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His head had been turned aside; and while there had been no danger of his
      glance, Ella had scanned his face as a girl does that of a man who is
      already something more to her than friend or brother. It was thin and
      intellectual, somewhat careworn, with deep vertical lines between the
      brows. The hair was black and wavy, thinning a little over the temples;
      the features well cut and sensitive; the eyes, deeply sunken, possessing
      keenness, but little brilliance; a moustache, standing well away at each
      end from the cheeks, accentuated their sharp contours. Yet in spite of the
      intellectual delicacy of the face, the tanned, rough skin, corresponding
      with the well-knit wiriness of his frame, gave assurance of strong
      physical health.
    </p>
    <p>
      The last epithet in his remarks, so at variance with the character she was
      idealising from her scrutiny, moved her ready indignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like to have, a quarter of an hour with the fool that said so!&rdquo;
       she exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are loyal to your friends,&rdquo; said Sylvester.
    </p>
    <p>
      They discussed the point. Ella let loose the fine scorn of five and twenty
      for the shallow society that could not appreciate a man of his calibre.
      Her championship was sweet for him to hear. For some time past he had been
      gradually growing conscious of the force that this sympathetic
      intelligence and this warm nature were bringing into his life. Unwittingly
      he had revealed the fact to Ella. As woman, and especially the fresh girl,
      is responsive, and gives bit by bit of herself, as it is craved, Ella,
      when she looked into her heart, found much that had been yielded. The
      situation therefore was sweet and delicate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My going will be a blow to my father,&rdquo; he said after a while. &ldquo;I hardly
      like to tell him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He wouldn't stand in your way,&rdquo; said Ella. &ldquo;He's not like that. We have
      talked it over scores of times. He is as anxious as I am for you to take
      your proper place in the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear old fellow,&rdquo; said Sylvester, his face brightening. &ldquo;He would cut off
      both his feet for me, gladly. But he would feel the pain all the same.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, who wouldn't love him?&rdquo; said Ella.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish I had a father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll go shares in him,&rdquo; said Sylvester.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His heart is big enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And again the girl coloured and felt very happy, as if the puzzle of her
      life were being explained to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Dorothy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's where the difficulty comes in. Would London be good for her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not leave her here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ella looked at him sharply and saw, as she had expected, the alarm on his
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't know what she is to me,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would cheer Uncle Matthew when you 're gone. He is devoted to her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was silent awhile. The thought of parting from the child, the living
      memory of his dead wife; was a pang whose intensity he could not express
      even to Ella. She was seven. For four years he had brought her up alone in
      his own house, under the care of an old family servant who had taught her
      to read, and say her prayers, and use her knife and fork in a way
      befitting her station. The rest of her tiny education Sylvester himself
      had seen to. She was his constant companion, abroad and at home.
    </p>
    <p>
      He could talk to her as it was in his power to&mdash;talk to no one else,
      almost persuading himself that her innocent clear eyes saw into the depths
      of his heart. To leave her behind was a prospect filled with unspeakable
      dismay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a weary world,&rdquo; he said, by way of generalisation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn't!&rdquo; cried Ella. &ldquo;It's a glorious world, full of love and heroism
      and beauty. I won't have my dear world abused! It is sweet to be alive in
      it, to use all one's faculties, to go about among men and women, to hear
      the rain, to smell the hay&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And get hay fever and then come to me&mdash;the misanthrope&mdash;to cure
      you. Paganism generally ends that way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should call your being able to cure me a very beautiful thing too,&rdquo; she
      exclaimed conclusively. &ldquo;Isn't your knowledge of healing a glorious
      thing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, don't tell me about the child gathering pebbles by the sea-shore.&rdquo; It
      was modesty on Newton's part, but mock modesty on that of the people who
      quote him now. &ldquo;Children can pick up a tremendous lot of pebbles in two
      hundred years!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The door opened and Matthew Lanyon stood on the threshold, with an amused
      smile on his grave face. For the girl had been speaking with animation,
      and the fresh colour in her cheeks and the happiness in her eyes made her
      goodly to look upon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Syl annihilated as usual?&rdquo; he asked, coming forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope so. He won't be converted, Uncle Matthew. What do you think of the
      world? Isn't it a beautiful world?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since it holds you, my dear, how could it be otherwise?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She laughed and looked at Sylvester with some coquetry. Here was a lesson
      in compliment by which he might profit. Sylvester thrust forward an
      armchair for his father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tired?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course not. What has a healthy man got to do with being tired? No, my
      dear Ella, please don't. You know I disapprove of cushions. They are for
      the young and delicate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where shall we haye tea?&rdquo; asked Ella. &ldquo;Here, or in the drawing-room? Aunt
      Agatha is in her district.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, here, then, by all means. We can have it comfortably.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ella rang the bell and cleared an occasional table of a litter of pipes,
      cigar-boxes, and papers. Matthew Lanyon lay back in his chair with the air
      of a man who had earned his home comforts, and stretched out his feet to
      the fire. Then he put his invariable question,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How's Dorothy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sylvester replied, gave the usual bulletin as to her health, recounted the
      small incidents in the child's day. She had driven with him on his rounds
      that morning; during one of the waits had urgently requested Peck, the
      coachman, to die forthwith&mdash;straight and stiff&mdash;so that she
      might have the pleasure of seeing how her father brought him to life
      again. Her mind had been much exercised by a picture in the Family Bible
      of the raising of Jairus' daughter, and had identified her parent with the
      chief actor in the scene.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tea arrived during the narration. Matthew listened with amused interest,
      for his son and his son's child were the dearest things earth held for
      him. His wife had died many years ago, when Sylvester was just emerging
      from boyhood and the great glory had gone out of his heaven. But his love
      for Sylvester had deepened, and of late years the sad parallelism of their
      widowed lives had drawn the two men very near together. In many ways they
      were singularly alike, the mere facial resemblance stamping them at the
      first glance as father and son; both were grave, intellectual-looking men,
      of the same clean, wiry make, with an air of reserve and good breeding
      that commanded respect. But the older man possessed that peculiar grace of
      manner, called nowadays of the old school, which the brusquer habits of
      more modern times have forbidden to flourish. Both faces bore the marks of
      suffering; but the passage of the years had chastened that of the father,
      who looked more frankly at the world than the son and out of kindlier grey
      eyes. He was a little over sixty, his hair whitening fast; still he held
      himself erect, and scoffed satirically at old age.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The prime of life, my dear sir,&rdquo; he would say, &ldquo;the heyday of existence!
      Up to sixty a man gathers his experience and tears his fingers dreadfully.
      After sixty he can sit down quietly and enjoy it and let his fingers
      heal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a pause in the talk, and the three sat, as they often did,
      content to be together, looking into the fire and thinking their own
      thoughts. Perhaps the girl's were the happiest. The room had darkened, and
      the firelight played on their faces gathered round the hearth. Suddenly
      Sylvester spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was talking to Ella about my plans, father, before you came in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A very sensible person to talk to,&rdquo; said Matthew.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've burned my ships. I have sold the practice and am going to join
      Frodsham in London.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm very glad indeed to hear it,&rdquo; said the old man; &ldquo;you should have done
      it years ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His voice was suave and even, but the keen eye of the physician detected a
      trembling of the fingers resting on the broad leathern arm of the chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't at all like to leave you,&rdquo; said Sylvester, feeling guilty.
      Matthew waved away the reluctance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense, my boy. I'm not a cripple that requires to be taken care of.
      Grown up men can't be for ever hanging on to&mdash;I was going to say, to
      each other's apron strings. London is your place. Perhaps after a time,
      when I am dead and gone,&mdash;a man must die some day, you know,&mdash;you'll
      like to come back to the old house and devote yourself entirely to
      research and be independent of two guinea fees and that kind of thing.
      That would be nice, wouldn't it, Ella?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl's heart throbbed at the share implied, but a tenderer feeling
      quieted it at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be impossible without you, Uncle Matthew,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He rose with a laugh. &ldquo;None of us are indispensable, not even the most
      futile. I'm going to dress. You'll dine here, of course, Syl? And, Ella,
      tell them to get up some of the '84' Pommery to drink good luck to Syl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He walked out of the room with the brisk air of a man thoroughly pleased
      with life; but outside, in the passage, his face grew sad, and he mounted
      the stairs to his dressing-room very slowly, holding on to the balusters.
    </p>
    <p>
      The younger folks remained for a while longer in the library. Sylvester
      bent forward and broke a great lump of coal with the poker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not fit to black his boots, you know, My companionship means much
      more to him than Dorothy's does to me, and he gives it up without a
      murmur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that settles the Dorothy question?&rdquo; asked Ella, in the direct manner
      that sometimes embarrassed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course it settles it,&rdquo; he cried warmly. &ldquo;What a selfish beast you must
      have thought me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you didn't love others so warmly, I shouldn't&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She came to a dead stop because his eyes were full upon her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shouldn't care for you so much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you care very much for me?&rdquo; he asked rather wistfully, and came to
      where she was standing with one foot on the fender.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know I would do anything in the world you asked,&rdquo; she answered in a
      low voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some day I may claim your promise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know I always keep my promises,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dressing bell clanged loudly through the house. Sylvester hurriedly
      departed so as to dress in time for dinner. But Ella lingered by the fire,
      the girl in her wondering whether she had said too much, and the woman in
      her filled with a delicious pity for the strong-brained, deep-natured man
      who seemed dumbly to be holding out his hands for her love. She gave it
      generously and gratefully. Compared with him, all other men seemed of
      small account, and in her aunt Lady Milmo's house, where most of her life
      was spent, she had seen all the sorts and conditions of males that a
      well-to-do collector of minor celebrities can gather around her in London.
      But to her direct mind the truest men of her acquaintance were Matthew
      Lanyon, her former guardian, whose title of uncle was purely one of
      courtesy, and Sylvester, with whom the old quasi-cousinly relations were
      being transmuted into sweeter ties.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II&mdash;THE SHADOW IN A LIFE
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">F</span>ather and son sat
      together in the dining-room, smoking their after-dinner cigars, and
      speaking very little, as their custom was when together. With its
      snow-white table-cloth set off by the glass and cut flowers and the rich
      purple of the old port in the decanter; with its picture-hung walls, its
      massive mahogany sideboard gleaming with silver, amid which displayed
      itself opulently a huge salver presented to Matthew Lanyon, Esquire, by
      his fellow-townsmen on the completion of his third year of mayoralty; with
      its great red-shaded lamp suspended over the table, and its dark marble
      fireplace,&mdash;the room had an air of warmth and generous comfort that
      spoke of a long continuance of worldly ease. In his younger days Matthew
      Lanyon had roved about the world, picking up much knowledge of men in new
      lands where life was rude, and a little money wherewith to start a career
      when he returned to civilisation. His return was speedier than either
      himself or his friends had anticipated. The latter beheld him married to a
      sweet flower-like girl whom he had met not long before in Australia; but
      more than this they did not learn. He was not given to offering
      information as to his doings, and there was that suggestion of haughtiness
      behind his frank young smile which forbade questioning. He was there; his
      wife was there. The friends must accept both on their merits. He had
      served his articles as a solicitor before leaving England. He turned to
      his profession for maintenance and bought a share in a cousin's practice
      in Ayresford. He was to have made his fortune, gone away again with his
      young wife into the wide world, and seen all the wonders that it held. But
      as in the case of many other young dreams, it seemed otherwise to the
      gods. Wealth had come quickly, and he had added gradually to his little
      home until it had become a great house, and his cousin had died, and his
      wife had died, and in Ayresford he had lived all the time, married and
      widowed, and now the longing for change had gone, and in Ayresford he
      hoped that he himself would die, in the home endeared to him by so many
      memories, in the bed consecrated by the pale sweet shadow of her who even
      now seemed to lie by his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wealth had come, yet much of it had gone; how, no man knew but himself and
      one other; he had toiled hard to win it, was toiling hard at sixty to win
      it back. And how strenuously he toiled, again no man knew; least of all
      his son.
    </p>
    <p>
      The desultory talk had drooped. Suddenly Matthew Lanyon plunged his hand
      in the breast pocket of his dress-coat and drew out an old-fashioned
      miniature, which, after regarding it for a few moments, he handed to
      Sylvester.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've been rummaging about to-day and found this. Perhaps you'd like to
      have it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My mother!&rdquo; said Sylvester.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a portrait, on ivory, of a singularly sweet face, possessing the
      tender, unearthly purity of one of Lorenzo di Credi's Madonnas, executed
      when the original was very young, a few months, in fact, before Sylvester
      was born.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A very good likeness,&rdquo; said Matthew.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be glad to keep it,&rdquo; replied the son, putting it into his pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought you would,&rdquo; assented the elder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will be a companion to my miniature of Constance,&rdquo; said Sylvester.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then silence came again; for memories crowded into the minds of each
      that they knew not how to speak of. Yet each knew that the other was
      thinking of his dead wife and wished that he could burst the strange bonds
      of reserve that held him and speak out that which was in his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a devil of a muddle, isn't it?&rdquo; said Matthew at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The cosmos. And the more one tries to establish order, the worse
      confounded becomes the confusion. The high gods seem to have given it up
      as a bad job.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That reminds me,&rdquo; said Sylvester, with a laugh. &ldquo;I found Billings to-day
      having a glorious drunk on champagne. For a man earning twenty-five
      shillings a week, with a large family to support and a wife half dying of
      pneumonia, I thought it rather strong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Matthew rose from his chair, his brows bent and his eyes kindling with
      sudden anger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The damned hound! What did you do with him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I took him outside so as not to disturb his wife and then I kicked him
      until he was sober,&rdquo; replied Sylvester, grimly. &ldquo;I wonder who could have
      sent the champagne.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some silly fool,&rdquo; said Matthew, nursing his wrath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet nearer to heaven than most of us,&rdquo; said Sylvester, knocking the ash
      off his cigar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rubbish!&rdquo; said Matthew. &ldquo;Besides, silly fools don't go to heaven. There's
      no place for 'em.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't think Billings will rob his wife again,&rdquo; remarked Sylvester.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you can send him up to me in the morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think he'd sooner have another kicking,&rdquo; laughed Sylvester.
    </p>
    <p>
      A picture rose before him of the reprobate cringing before his father,
      wriggling at each sentence as at a whip lash, and going away with two more
      bottles of wine that would burn his dirty hands like hot bricks. He
      laughed, but Matthew thrust both hands in his pockets and stood with feet
      apart on the hearth-rug.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you ever hear of such a mean skunk?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will never fathom the depth of human meanness, father, if you live to
      be a hundred.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thank you for the compliment, Syl,&rdquo; replied the old man, drily, &ldquo;but I
      happen to think otherwise. May you never live to know it as I do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Usher, sir,&rdquo; said the servant, suddenly throwing open the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Matthew started, and glanced instinctively at his son. Sylvester, who had
      been struck by an unusual note of emotion in his father's voice, was
      looking at him curiously. So their eyes met in a mutual sensitive glance,
      and Matthew flushed slightly beneath his tanned and care-lined skin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Confound Usher!&rdquo; muttered Sylvester, irritably.
    </p>
    <p>
      An elderly man of about Matthew's age appeared, white-bearded,
      gold-spectacled, wearing a tightly buttoned frock-coat. He was of heavy
      build and had loose lips and dull watery eyes, the lids faintly rimmed
      with blood-red. He came forward into the room with extended hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear friend, how are you this evening?&rdquo; he said with a curious
      deliberation, as if he had duly sucked each word before he spat it out.
      &ldquo;And, Sylvester, my dear lad, how are you? I have been very unwell to-day,
      and the weather has increased my sufferings. You notice that there is a
      wheezing in my bronchial tubes. Yet I thought I must come to see you this
      evening in spite of the weather. I said to Olivia, 'It is a duty, and I
      must fulfil it.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray sit down, Usher,&rdquo; said Matthew, politely. &ldquo;Let me pass you the
      port.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A little port wine would be very good for me. I cannot afford port wine,
      Matthew, like you, or I should drink it habitually. I should think this
      was very expensive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He smacked his loose lips and held the glass up to the light.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a sound wine,&rdquo; said Matthew.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you would not put too high a price on it,&rdquo; said the other, in his
      monotonous voice, &ldquo;perhaps I might buy some from you. What would you
      charge?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the market it would fetch about a hundred and eighty shillings a
      dozen,&rdquo; said Sylvester, savagely.
    </p>
    <p>
      But his father raised a hand in courteous deprecation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not a wine-merchant, Usher, and am not in the habit of retailing my
      cellar. But if you'd accept a dozen, I should be very pleased to send it
      round to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will accept it with great pleasure,&rdquo; said Usher, blandly. &ldquo;It would
      hurt your feelings if I refused your generosity. Have you ever remarked
      how generous your father is, Sylvester?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young man moved impatiently in his chair. He could never understand
      the almost lifelong intimacy that existed between his father and this old
      man, Usher, whom he held in cordial detestation. So he said nothing, while
      the guest took a fresh sip of wine, and rolled it appreciatively over his
      tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your father and I were young men together in Australia, Sylvester,&rdquo; he
      remarked. &ldquo;Youth is a glorious time, and its friendships last. I never
      forget my old friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The sentiment does you credit, Usher,&rdquo; said Matthew.
    </p>
    <p>
      The servant entered with the London evening paper just sent from the
      railway bookstall. Usher held out a large soft hand for it, and the
      servant retired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to see what has happened in the Trevelyan divorce case,&rdquo; he said,
      unfolding the paper. &ldquo;I have followed it closely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A <i>cause celebre</i> was setting England whispering and sniggering, and
      there were many like Usher who scanned the columns of the newspapers
      that evening in pleased anticipation. But Sylvester expressed his
      distaste.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can you read it? The air is reeking sufficiently with the nastiness
      already.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am interested,&rdquo; replied Usher. &ldquo;I think nothing human alien to me. <i>Nil
      humani</i>, as we used to say at school. I remember my classics. I have a
      very good memory. Here it is. The jury found Mrs. Trevelyan guilty of
      adultery with the co-respondent. Damages £5000 and costs. The judge
      pronounced a decree <i>nisi</i>; the husband to have custody of the
      children. I pity the poor woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't,&rdquo; said Sylvester, shortly. &ldquo;Such women are better dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No doubt you are right,&rdquo; returned Usher. &ldquo;The sacred principles of
      morality ought to be upheld at any cost. I have always upheld morality.
      What do you think, Matthew?&rdquo; The old man looked steadily at his finger
      nails and replied in a dispassionate voice,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One never knows what lies behind.&rdquo; Sylvester rose and shrugged his
      shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wantonness and baseness lie behind. I have no patience with misplaced
      sympathy in such cases. Here is this woman you are reading about,&mdash;she
      betrayed her husband, deserted her children. She deserves no pity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Usher waggled his head indulgently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am a Christian man,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and I have a tender heart. I have always
      had a tender heart, Matthew.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sylvester laughed and threw the end of his cigar into the fire. He was
      half ashamed of having been betrayed into a display of deep feeling before
      one whom he considered a shallow egotist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I haven't,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I'm going up to the drawing-room. Perhaps
      you'll join me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He nodded to his father and left the room. Matthew edged his chair further
      from the fire, and wiped his lips and brow with his handkerchief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are getting too warm,&rdquo; said Usher.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The room is hot. When you have finished your wine, we may as well follow
      Sylvester.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Usher poured out another glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very comfortable,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I always am here. You must be proud to
      have a son with such sentiments as Sylvester.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Matthew rose abruptly from his seat, clenched his hands by his side, and
      bit a quivering lip. Evidently he was mastering something.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Drink your wine and come upstairs,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other looked at him askance and hesitated. Then yielding, as it were,
      to compulsion, he gulped down the contents of his glass and rose with
      watery eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was a sin to do that,&rdquo; he said with a sigh. &ldquo;You always were an
      unreasonable fellow, Matthew. I only said I was glad that Sylvester held
      such opinions. Most young men nowadays are shockingly lax in their
      principles.&rdquo; Matthew did not reply, but with cold, imperturbable face
      opened the door for him to pass out. Usher hung back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must speak to you about my son Roderick. Business before pleasure. It
      has been my constant rule in life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What has Roderick been doing now?&rdquo; asked Matthew, closing the door again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is bringing my grey hairs in sorrow to the grave again,&rdquo; replied
      Usher. &ldquo;My son and your son&mdash;what a difference, Matthew! 'Tis
      sharper than&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rubbish! What's the matter, man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A serpents tooth, to have a thankless child. I dislike being interrupted.
      Matthew, Roderick has gone to the Jews. The bills have fallen due. They
      won't renew, and if they are not paid, they'll put him in prison. I cannot
      have my son in prison.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get him out, then,&rdquo; replied Matthew. &ldquo;I can't do more for him than I do.
      I promised, years ago, that what Sylvester had, Roderick should have, and,
      by Heaven! I've kept my promise. I can't do more. You can't draw blood
      from a stone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As if any one ever wanted to. Proverbs are foolish. I never make use of
      proverbs. I think you must take up those bills.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if I don't?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Usher shrugged his shoulders and, sitting down again, refilled his glass
      and held it up to the light. Matthew stood on the hearth-rug, his hands
      behind him, and regarded him impassively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I gave you Roderick's quarterly allowance only a short while ago. What
      has he done with it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not know,&rdquo; said Usher, impressively, turning his dull venerable face
      towards him. &ldquo;He has nearly ruined me already.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you brought his letters with you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I burned his letters. It is imprudent to keep compromising letters. But I
      have made out a statement of affairs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Usher took from his pocket a double sheet of foolscap, smoothed it out and
      examined it deliberately, then handed it to Matthew. The latter glanced
      through the statement. His lips quivered for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is practically fraud,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;A magistrate might commit on it, a
      jury find a verdict of guilty, and then&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His dear mother's memory,&rdquo; said Usher, wagging his head solemnly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Matthew involuntarily clenched the paper tight in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Damn you!&rdquo; he said. Then he repeated it. &ldquo;Damn you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Usher stretched out a deprecating hand and spoke in tones of gentle
      reproach.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must be calm, my dear friend. I am always calm. I have never said a
      word in all my life that I have had cause to regret. Not even this
      morning, when Olivia with great carelessness destroyed a new book-plate.
      And it was a very valuable book-plate. It belonged to Hugh, the first Earl
      of Lawford, of Edward III.'s creation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you aware that your own son is in danger of penal servitude?&rdquo; asked
      Matthew, sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, of course. Is not that my reason for coming to you? I put the matter
      into your hands, as lawyer and friend and second father to my erring boy,
      and I am content. Yes, I am content, for I have trust in you. Shall we go
      up now and join the ladies?&rdquo; Matthew bit the end off another cigar and
      lighted it. Then, as if his guest had made the most natural and relevant
      proposal in the world, he said with a courtesy not devoid of grimness,&mdash;&ldquo;My
      sister is not feeling very well this evening, and the young folks might be
      happier alone together, so perhaps we'll not go upstairs. And as this
      affair of Roderick's will give me some thinking, you'll excuse me if I
      leave you shortly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right,&rdquo; replied Usher, rising ponderously. &ldquo;The night air is not
      good for me. I suffer much from my bronchial tubes. I must have some one
      fitter than Olivia to nurse me. Servants are never grateful for the
      bounties one heaps on them. If only Miss Defries would look upon Roderick
      as favourably as she does upon Sylvester, how happily things could be
      arranged.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was not a spark of cunning or rearward thought in his dim,
      unspeculative eyes. Yet Matthew felt a sudden pang of suspicion at his
      last words, and scanned his face intently. Was it the first hint of some
      scheme long maturing in his dull yet tenacious brain, or the mere surface
      fancy of the egotist? He could not tell, although he flattered himself
      that he knew the man's soul as a priest his breviary,&mdash;every line and
      phrase, every thumb-mark and dog's ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think the less said about Roderick for some time, the better,&rdquo; he
      remarked, ringing the bell. Then before the servant came, he said
      suddenly,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, by Heaven! this is the last time. Understand that. Once more, and I
      break down the whole structure though it kill me&mdash;carry the war into
      your quarters and tell Roderick all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Usher's face was shadowed by a faint smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear friend, Roderick has known all his life. I could never leave my
      son in ignorance. I gave him the best training.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The servant appeared. Usher extended his hand, which the other touched
      mechanically, and in another moment was gone, leaving Matthew staring
      incredulously, conscious of utter dismay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he lying?&rdquo; he asked himself, a short while later, as he paced the
      library, whither he had betaken himself with the moneylending document.
      &ldquo;Can the boy be such a blackguard? He must be lying.&rdquo; But how base the lie
      was in reality, even he could not surmise.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy was a man of forty now, yet Matthew had watched and paid for every
      step upward and downward in his career. He remembered him a handsome and
      wayward child, a wild lad, a young man brilliant in promise, yet unstable
      as water, excelling in naught. He had seen him by turns poet, painter,
      journalist, social reformer, musical critic, dramatist, always obtaining
      successes of estimation, always floating iridescent and futile as froth on
      the waves of literary and artistic London. What Roderick was doing now, he
      did not know. For some time past he had heard little of him. Now he had
      come to light again somewhat luridly. A foolish friend had backed bills
      under false representations. The Jews were pressing, the friend
      recalcitrant. It was a criminal matter. If he were guilty of this, why not
      of that knowledge of which his father boasted so cynically? Matthew's face
      grew worn and hard. He unlocked a safe, drew therefrom a small padlocked
      ledger, and sitting down at his desk began to pore over its contents.
      Roderick must be saved this time at any cost, for his mother's sake, as
      Usher had remarked. At the reminiscence Matthew reiterated his execration.
    </p>
    <p>
      After long, anxious thought, he made a rough calculation on a scrap of
      paper, and leaning back in his chair regarded it until something dim, like
      tears, came across his vision.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My poor Syl,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I have to rob you&mdash;for your own happiness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And at that moment, just outside the door stood Sylvester and Ella bidding
      each other good-night. The full glow of the hall lamp shone down upon her
      radiant young face, as he held both her hands in his, and made a glinting
      aureole of her hair. Suddenly he laughed awkwardly and kissed her; with a
      half-mirthful, half-reproachful &ldquo;Oh, you shouldn't!&rdquo; she snatched away her
      hands and ran up the stairs. He stood and watched the last gleam of her
      skirts disappear and then entered his father's room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Matthew closed his ledger and looked up with one of his rare smiles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Going, Syl?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I 've been sent for, as usual. It's all very well for me to work at
      this ungodly hour. I'm a medical man, and I'm young. But I don't like to
      see you at it. You 're overdoing it, father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; replied Matthew, cheerily; &ldquo;I'm as strong as a horse and
      younger than you are. Besides, I was only amusing myself, like the king in
      his counting-house, counting out my money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He rubbed his eyes, yawned, and stretched himself contentedly in his
      chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Usher kept me a long time,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;telling me one of his
      interminable yarns&mdash;<i>a dormir debout</i>, as the French say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't think how you stand him,&rdquo; said Sylvester.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you can stand a devil of a lot if you try,&rdquo; said the old man,
      laughing. &ldquo;Have some whisky before you go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Syl pleaded urgency, went out for hat and coat, and returned ready for
      departure. His father accompanied him to the front door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the way, Syl,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;do you really think so hardly of the woman
      who sins, or was it only that Usher made you contradictious?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think a woman must be pure and chaste. If she falls, she falls for
      ever. Why do you ask?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I only wanted to know if you were genuine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the most sacred of my convictions,&rdquo; said Sylvester, gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two men shook hands, and the door closed behind Sylvester. The father
      listened to his quick footsteps crunching the gravel until the sound died
      away. Then he turned and sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My poor lad, God help you,&rdquo; he said.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III&mdash;SYLVESTER CONSULTS THE STARS
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">S</span>ylvester walked
      home from his case, along the undulating high-road patched with moonlight
      and shadow, swinging his stick. The night was crisp with a touch of frost,
      and the air smelt sweet. Now and then a workingman regaining his home
      after town convivialities, passed him by with a salute to which he replied
      with a cheerier good-night than usual. One he stopped, and discoursed with
      him at length on family ailments, much to the man's surprise; for
      Sylvester was renowned far and wide for his shy silence as well as for his
      skill. Once he began to whistle an air, wofully out of tune, and then
      broke into a short laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, Ella was right. It was good to be alive, to feel heart and brain and
      body on the alert, responsive to outer things. But whence had come the
      change? It was years since he had felt so young and conscious of power.
      Was it the touch of a girl's fresh cheek against his lips? He did not
      know. The feelings that had prompted the act were too new, too undefined,
      for immediate analysis. The spell of the benumbing heartache that had held
      him nerveless for four long years seemed to be broken, and he was a man
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked upward at the stars in the simple fancy that the dear dead wife,
      the Constance he had worshipped so passionately, was gazing down upon him
      with happy consent in her pure eyes. The love he had given her was
      immortal, and she knew it. It was no disloyalty to love another sweet
      woman on earth and to put his own broken life and his motherless child
      into her keeping.... Yet after a few moments he lowered his gaze for a
      while and walked on, his heart filled with the old love.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was one of those reserved natures, capable of intense feeling, yet
      incapable of outward expression, who make for themselves few friends and
      are often condemned to loneliness of soul. Born with greater cravings for
      sympathy than most men, they have less power to demand it. This is too
      busy a world for us to stop to wonder whether a man wants what he does not
      ask for; too many are clamouring loudly for what we cannot give. So the
      unfortunates are passed by unheeded, each working out in his heart his
      little tragedy of unfulfilled longings. But when a finer spirit comes and
      divines their needs, then their hearts leap towards it and cling to it
      with a great unexpressed passion of gratitude. Such had been the beginning
      of Sylvesters love for his wife; such that of his dawning love for Ella.
      Each in her way had comprehended his solitude; unasked in words, but
      spiritually besought, each had filled it with her influence. He needed the
      peculiar sympathy that a woman alone can give, her companionship, her
      practical intellect, to complement his theoretic mind. His nature cried
      dumbly for a whole-hearted, expansive creature to give objectivity to
      life. Left to himself, he sank into routine; he lacked the power of
      bringing colour and harmony into his world. This the woman he loved could
      do. Once, for a few short years, a woman had changed his universe. Then
      she had died, and the blackness of night had encompassed him. He had
      suffered silently, as a strong man suffers, rarely mentioning her name,
      but eating out his heart in desolation; and then Ella had come. He had
      known her from early childhood, but had last seen her as the schoolgirl of
      no account.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now she had sprung into his horizon, a young and splendid woman of amazing
      opposites, who compelled attention; and she was the only woman other than
      Constance who, during all his life, had sought to know him and to act
      towards him tenderwise. Nevertheless, he could not say as yet that he
      loved her, in the sweet and common way of love. The old and new hung
      equipoised on a delicate balance. The vague sense of this, perhaps, was
      one element in the rare exaltation of his mood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another element, no doubt, was the final resolve he had taken that
      morning, to go to London, whither his ambitions summoned him. He was a
      specialist of some note in zymotic diseases. His researches had met with a
      recognition not confined to England. He had felt keenly that he was giving
      up to the small circle of a country practice what was meant for the
      general needs of mankind. London was the only place for study and work;
      for the quick amassing, too, of the small fortune that would free him from
      the necessity of earning daily bread and would allow him to realise his
      dreams of a great bacteriological laboratory, where he could devote
      himself exclusively to independent research.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was at the urgent entreaty of Constance that he had bought, just before
      his marriage, the practice at Ayresford. A year's life there had made him
      regret London. A little later he had spoken of returning. She had thrown
      her arms about him and implored him by all his love for her to stay. She
      had a horror of London; why, she could not tell. It was unreasonable, but
      the fact remained. London would kill her,&mdash;its gloom, its hardness,
      its cruelty. It had been the same story whenever he had broached the
      subject. And then, Dorothy. The child was delicate, would pine away in the
      reek and fogs of the town. All her woman's armoury of passionate weapons
      had been employed. And he had yielded, out of his great love. Her death
      had set him free. But it had taken him four years to realise his freedom.
      The mere thought had been anguish. Now he could gaze upon the past with
      calmness and the future with hope. As he walked along, he began to picture
      the vigorous life before him. He passed from wide conception to trivial
      details,&mdash;the fittings of his library, domestic economies. A room for
      Dorothy&mdash;he pulled himself up short. He had arranged to part with
      her. The prospect brought a pang. His father's comfort in the child,
      however, was a consolation. He thought of him tenderly,&mdash;the dear old
      man, the most generous and unselfish being who had ever blessed the earth.
      He was a man of deep reverences; his father, his dead mother, and his dead
      wife were enshrined in his Holy of Holies. Dorothy, then, should remain at
      Ayresford. Perhaps the separation would not be for long. There was a means
      of shortening it whose readiness was a great temptation. The vision rose
      before him of the child's dark curls nestling against a girl's soft
      shoulder. Often had he seen the reality of late, and it had disturbed his
      depths. Was it not his duty to give the little one so sweet and strong a
      mother? Again he consulted the stars.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had reached a set of workmen's cottages in process of erection, on
      either side of the road, which marked the beginning of the town. The
      moonlight beat hard upon them, showing up vividly their windowless and
      doorless skeletons and the piles of bricks, mortar, and lime-covered
      boards at their thresholds. He had passed the first block and was about to
      traverse a cross-road that led to the railway station, when a dog-cart
      containing two men and some luggage turned out of it sharply on to the
      highway. Before he could realise the fact, the vehicle suddenly lurched,
      the horse plunged, and in a moment the occupants were thrown heavily on to
      the road. Sylvester could see at once the cause of the mishap. A pail of
      mortar left by the roadside, either through carelessness or urchin
      mischief, had caught the wheel. He ran forward. One of the men, the
      driver, rose, and shaking himself went to the horse's head, which was
      turned round in calm inquiry. The other man lay still.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hurt?&rdquo; cried Sylvester.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, doctor,&rdquo; replied the driver, who belonged to the George Hotel of
      Ayresford. &ldquo;The gentleman may be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He left the pacific animal, and bent with Sylvester over the prostrate
      form.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was that of a handsome, full-blooded man in the prime of life. He had
      fair hair and a great moustache. His face gleamed very white beneath the
      moon, and his eyes were glassy. The driver supported his head, while
      Sylvester straightened the inert body, which had remained huddled together
      after the fall, wrapped in a disordered Inverness cape. Apparently no
      bones were broken. Sylvester felt his pulse, which was just perceptible.
      Then suddenly he viewed the man's face full, and started back in amazed
      distress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good heavens! it's Frank Leroux!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's the gentleman's name, sir,&rdquo; said the driver.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He telegraphed from London for a bed to-night, saying that he was to be
      met by the last train, which I just did, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he's my oldest friend,&rdquo; exclaimed Sylvester. &ldquo;Leave him to me and see
      if the trap is all right. Bring the cushions for his head.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He pursued his investigations. Leroux was alive. A trickle of blood damped
      his hair. After a while Sylvester drew an anxious breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a severe concussion; how grave he could not for the moment
      estimate. To drive him in the narrow two-wheeled cart was out of the
      question. He hailed the driver, who had righted the vehicle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get a ambulance as quick as you can from the Infirm. That's nearest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man touched his hat, and mounting drove off at a forced speed.
      Sylvester remained by Leroux, and having done all that was momentarily
      possible, was at last able to reflect upon the entire unexpectedness of
      his presence. They were old friends, had been at school and at Guy's
      together. Leroux, who was somewhat of a waif in the world, had spent many
      holidays here in Ayresford, at Woodlands. And even after he had thrown
      over medicine for painting, they had maintained the old relations.
      Sylvester had reckoned upon him being best man at his wedding; and when
      for some whimsical reason, which Sylvester could never discover but
      attributed to the artistic temperament, he declined and went off to
      Norway, the bridegroom elect knew no one intimately enough to appoint in
      his stead save Roderick Usher, against whom he had a constitutional
      antipathy. Although he had seen little of him during his married life,
      owing to his confinement in the country, and had heard little of him of
      late years, save that he was abroad, Sylvester still entertained for him
      the warmest affection. How, therefore, was he to explain this sudden
      unannounced appearance in Ayresford? It was preposterous that Frank Leroux
      should put up at the George Hotel; as preposterous as if he himself, in
      earlier days, had driven there instead of to Woodlands. The act was a sort
      of treason against friendship, and Sylvester felt absurdly hurt. He wished
      that Leroux would straightway recover consciousness and health so that he
      could rate him soundly for his unfriendliness. But there the man, with all
      the mystery of motive locked in the dull brain, lay helpless and inert,
      amid the builder's refuse from the fantastic shells of houses hard by. It
      was an ironical way for friends to meet after an absence and a silence of
      years.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some stragglers from the station came up, passengers by the train, one or
      two porters, and the postman with the bag of local mails, and offered
      assistance. Sylvester declined, explaining briefly. Not daring to proffer
      suggestions as to the patient's treatment, they cursed in honest terms the
      offending pail and the worthless hands that had moved it, and loitered
      around. Dramatic incidents of a public kind are rare in Ayresford, and
      each man determined to make the most of this one, conscious, perhaps, of a
      lurking regret that he had not seen the accident.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon the dog-cart returned, bringing the ambulance and a couple of bearers
      from the Infirmary. Leroux was lifted on to the stretcher and covered with
      a blanket. The bearers started, the muffled form between them giving a
      ghastly suggestion of death in life; Sylvester walked by the side, the
      stragglers followed, and the trap brought up the rear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To my house,&rdquo; said Sylvester.
    </p>
    <p>
      The melancholy procession went on its way through the outskirts of the
      little town. The cottages gave place to villas, then came houses standing
      on their own grounds. Opposite the front gates of Woodlands was the
      doctor's house. Sylvester dismissed his followers at the gate and, taking
      Leroux's portmanteau from the trap, opened the door for the bearers and
      their burden, and directed their way upstairs. The old housekeeper, roused
      by the tramping, met them on the landing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a man hurt,&rdquo; explained Sylvester. &ldquo;Frank Leroux. We'll put him in my
      room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A short while afterwards, the unconscious man was settled in Sylvester's
      bed, a fire lighted, and Sylvester was left alone. Able to make a more
      minute diagnosis, he grew very grave and prepared for an all-night
      sitting.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      In the morning Leroux was still unconscious.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sylvester sent for a trained nurse, and as soon as she arrived and had
      received her instructions, he went over to Woodlands. The family were at
      breakfast. Miss Lanyon, a faded elderly woman, her lean shoulders
      enveloped in a black shawl, paused in the act of pouring out tea, tea-pot
      in hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Sylvester, what a dreadful thing! We have just heard. How is he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He briefly described the accident and hinted at the result, which might be
      fatal. Everything depended upon treatment and nursing. He had been up all
      night.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How tired you must be!&rdquo; said Ella.
    </p>
    <p>
      A world of tenderness underlay the commonplace words. Sylvester looked at
      her gratefully. She was deliciously fresh and sweet in her simple morning
      dress, and again Sylvester felt how gracious a thing was life,&mdash;especially
      after his night's battle with death. They talked of Leroux. All were
      deeply shocked by the news, for he had been a universal favourite. In the
      days past Ella had been accused of a schoolgirl flirtation with him. Miss
      Lanyon used to save up especial household goodies for his consumption
      during the holidays. Matthew, always fond of youth, had loved the boy's
      frank nature, and in his generous way had seldom let him leave the house
      without a five-pound note, or a watch, or a silver-mounted walking-stick
      in his possession. And now the prodigal had returned in this dismaying and
      tragic fashion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What I can't understand,&rdquo; said Sylvester, &ldquo;is why he did not announce his
      coming,&mdash;why he should suddenly turn up at that ungodly hour. There
      are plenty of day trains.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He appealed unconsciously to his father, who made no reply. But a little
      later, when Miss Lanyon and Ella had left the room, Matthew said, suddenly
      breaking a short silence,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was expecting him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why didn't you tell me?&rdquo; asked Sylvester, involuntarily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was in some trouble apparently, and asked to see me alone this morning
      on business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder what it could have been?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; said the old man, drily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sylvester flushed, as if at a rebuke. Knowing his father, he was aware of
      indiscretion. Matthew had always maintained the most impenetrable reserve
      as regards his business affairs; the son had been trained from childhood
      to look upon them as sacrosanct, and to question was an indecency.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon, father,&rdquo; he said deferentially.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mentioned the fact, for obvious reasons,&rdquo; said Matthew.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite so,&rdquo; said Sylvester, and then hesitating and finally blurting it
      out, as if he were ashamed of it, he added,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know you are a father confessor to every poor devil in trouble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man looked at his son and his kind eyes grew a little moist. Any
      tribute of faith and love from Sylvester touched him deeply. But he
      laughed and said characteristically,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are some people who'll tell you anything, if you 're only
      soft-headed enough to listen to them.&rdquo; Then he nodded towards the window,
      and waved his hand,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is one, anyhow, who doesn't want a confessor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was Ella, standing in the clear March sunshine of the garden, looking
      in through the French window, and holding up a bunch of fresh-gathered
      violets. With a word of adieu to his father, Sylvester went out and joined
      her. She pinned the flowers in his buttonhole and for ten pleasant minutes
      they walked along the trim-kept paths.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were not angry with me last night?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      She murmured very meekly,&mdash;&ldquo;If I were, I should not be here with you
      now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never thought I should&mdash;ever do such a thing again,&rdquo; he said
      awkwardly. &ldquo;I couldn't help it. It has made a different man of me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She drew herself up quite proudly and looked him straight in the eyes.
      They were brave, clear eyes, and so were the man's that met them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you in earnest?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I the man not to be in earnest?&rdquo; he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor's page, running across the strip of lawn to them, broke the
      spell with the time-honoured morning announcement,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is some one in the surgery, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sylvester dismissed the urchin and looked at his watch. It was some
      minutes past his consultation hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will have a long talk this evening,&rdquo; he said, bidding her farewell.

      CHAPTER IV&mdash;LEROUX SPEAKS
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>atthew and Miss
      Lanyon were standing under the front porch talking over poor Frank Leroux
      when Ella came up with a very happy face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a colour you 've got, child!&rdquo; cried Agatha Lanyon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the fresh country air. I was being choked in town.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the country people,&rdquo; suggested the elder lady, archly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the fresh country people,&rdquo; assented Ella.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; said Matthew to his sister, &ldquo;this is the first time we've been
      complimented on our adorable rusticity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We don't count,&rdquo; said Miss Lanyon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never knew you could be so wicked,&rdquo; cried Ella, taking her by her
      shoulders and kissing her. Whereupon she disappeared into the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do hope it is settled,&rdquo; said Miss Lanyon, with a little sentimental
      sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sylvester and Ella. Do you mean to say you haven't noticed? I have been
      following it all for months.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Lanyon had reached the age when one lives in the romances of others.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe you amuse yourself, Agatha, by mixing up your young friends and
      sorting them out in pairs, like gloves,&rdquo; remarked Matthew.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Lanyon denied the charge indignantly. This was quite a different
      matter. Anybody with eyes could see how things were tending. It was a
      match. She was sure it was a marriage made in heaven.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I like heaven-made marriages as little as machine-made boots,&rdquo; said
      Matthew. &ldquo;Both are apt to come undone in unexpected places. But if these
      two are thinking of a wholesome earth-made union&mdash;well, I shall be
      delighted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But hasn't Syl told you anything?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a word.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Couldn't you ask him, Matthew?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Agatha,&rdquo; said he, drawing himself up, &ldquo;how can you suggest my
      committing such an impertinence?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Lanyon worshipped her brother, but she felt there were many odd
      corners of his mind which needed the housewifely besom; just as there were
      cobwebs in his office which, on the rare occasions when she entered it,
      made her fingers twitch. But being organically acquiescent she sighed
      again sentimentally, and brought Matthew his hat and stick.
    </p>
    <p>
      For Ella, the hours of that day were winged with sunshine. She loved
      Sylvester as deeply as one of our untried, pure-minded Northern girls can
      love; and with larger wisdom, too, than most. For she had lived a free
      life in her aunt's eccentric house in London, and had sifted the vanities
      of many men. Passion would only be evoked by the clasp of encircling arms
      and would rise to meet claiming lips. As yet in Ella it lay a pure fire
      hidden in the depths of a fervent nature. But all the sweet thrills of a
      woman's early love were hers,&mdash;the pride in a strong man's wooing,
      the fluttering fears as to her sufficiency for his happiness, the
      resolves, scarce formulated, to raise herself to his level, the dim dreams
      of a noble life together, striving for the great things of the world that
      are worth the winning. Added thereto was the delicate charm, essentially
      feminine, of triumph over the shadows that had fought with her for
      possession of his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she entered her room to dress for dinner that evening, she took down
      her frocks and laid them on the bed, and stood a while in deep thought.
      She must look her best tonight. She chose a simple cream dress with
      chiffon round the bodice and sleeves. Halfway through her toilette she
      clasped her white arms over her neck, and looking in the glass held long
      converse with her image. It seemed so strange that she, with all her
      imperfections of soul and body, should be chosen to guide a man's destiny.
      Then lighter fancies prevailed, and she spent anxious moments in arranging
      her thick auburn hair. When she came down at last, with a diamond-hilted
      dagger thrust through the coils, and a bunch of violets peeping shyly from
      the chiffon in her corsage, Matthew paid her an old man's compliment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do I look nice?&rdquo; she asked, gratified. &ldquo;I'm glad; for you once told me
      that you liked me in this frock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There are times when the sincerest of women can be most blandly deceitful.
    </p>
    <p>

      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      A general practitioner may propose to himself many pleasant occupations
      for his spare hours, but his patients dispose of them effectually. On this
      particular day, when Sylvester craved leisure to watch over Leroux and to
      open his heart finally to Ella, impossible people fell sick at
      interminable distances, tiny human beings came with preposterous haste
      into this world of trouble, and larger ones gave sudden and alarming
      symptoms of leaving it. It was one of those well-known days of sudden
      stress when a country doctor eats his meals standing and wearing his
      overcoat. Finally, an evening visit from which he reckoned on being free
      by nine kept him by an anxious bedside till nearly eleven. But he had
      found time to despatch to Ella a few lines scribbled on a leaf of his
      pocket-book:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     <i>Dearest,&mdash;I can't come, much as I long to. Will see you in
     the morning. S. L.</i>
</pre>
    <p>
      This was almost the first letter he had ever written to her; certainly the
      first love-letter. The new sweetness of it soothed Ella's disappointment.
    </p>
    <p>
      At half-past eleven he reached his house, a very weary man. He put on his
      slippers, stretched himself, yawned, and thought wistfully of bed. But
      first he must go to Leroux, whom he had only seen at odd intervals during
      the day. He was pouring himself out some whisky when the housekeeper
      entered the dining-room, smoothing her apron.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm glad you 've come, Mr. Sylvester. He's took worse, nurse says. His
      temperature has gone up to 104.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He nodded, swallowed the drink, and went upstairs. The nurse was bending
      over the bed in the dimly lit room, adjusting the ice-bag. The sick man's
      portmanteau had been unpacked, and the contents were piled upon a chest of
      drawers. The clothes he had been wearing were hanging from a row of pegs
      against the door. The flap of the jacket turned outward, revealed in the
      breast-pocket a letter-case stuffed with papers. With the air of a man
      accustomed to prompt action, Sylvester withdrew the letter-case and locked
      it up. The nurse confirmed the housekeeper's statements.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has been delirious at times,&rdquo; she added.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sylvester bent down and placed the thermometer in position, then waited,
      looking gravely down upon his friend. Leroux's face was congested. His
      hands moved feebly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now and then he moaned. Sylvester examined him closely, inspected the
      temperature chart of the last few hours, questioned the nurse as to their
      history. A surmise that had been troubling him most of the day now
      converted itself into a certainty. Leroux must have been drinking heavily
      of late. Thus it was that meningitis had set in from the concussion. But
      why should Leroux, once the sanest and cleanest of men, have taken to
      drink? The pity of it smote Sylvester. The gay spirit brutalised, the
      noble mind o'erthrown. His heart yearned over the unconscious man. His
      father had spoken of Leroux being in trouble. He conjectured pitiful
      histories of downfall. With a sigh he turned away, gave final directions,
      and went to bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three hours later he was waked. The nurse outside the door was calling
      him. Accustomed to sudden rising, he leaped up, and thrusting on
      dressing-gown and slippers, went back to the sick room. Leroux was in full
      tide of violent delirium, his words, wonderfully articulate, striking
      almost spectrally upon the utter silence of the house,&mdash;&ldquo;It is better
      to die than to live in hell on earth. If you give me up, God Almighty will
      give me up.... What is his love to mine?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The nurse, who had been on duty since ten, was young and nervous.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has been like this for an hour. I couldn't stand it any longer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will go away to the south,&rdquo; continued Leroux. &ldquo;No one minds what a
      painter does&mdash;For God's sake don't give me up&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can go to bed, nurse,&rdquo; said Sylvester. &ldquo;I'll sit with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The tired girl, glad to gain some extra and unexpected hours of slumber,
      retired gratefully. Sylvester sat by the bedside. It was as well, he
      thought, that the man's poor secrets should be blabbed into a friend's
      ears instead of a stranger's. He tried not to listen, but to think of
      other things,&mdash;Ella and his meeting with her on the morrow. But the
      clear voice, now rising in ghastly emphasis, now sinking to a murmur
      losing itself in guttural incoherence, continued its tale of love and
      despair, so that Sylvester could not choose but piece it together in his
      mind. It was a common tale of unlawful love: a passionate man, a yielding
      woman, a deceived and adoring husband. Sylvester, whose reserved, chaste
      nature had caused him to train himself in a narrow groove of orthodox
      morality, felt strangely repelled by the confession. He had always
      regarded Leroux as the soul of honour. The thief of a man's wife was
      lowered in his esteem.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a silence. He rested his head on his hand and wearily dozed.
      Suddenly came a cry from the bed, a cry of great pain and longing,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Constance&mdash;Constance!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The name, fitting in with a waking dream, brought Sylvester with a leap to
      his feet, and he looked in foolish bewilderment at Leroux. The latter
      murmured incoherently. Had he dreamed the voice crying out the name so
      distinctly? He held his breath, trying to seize the half-formed syllables.
      &ldquo;Constance&mdash;my love&mdash;&rdquo; had come again. He had not been dreaming.
      The voice rose once more, and each word came sharply cut from the sick
      man's lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Sylvester will never know</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then the tremendous horror of the revelation crashed down upon the man,
      stunning his brain, paralysing his limbs. The great drops of sweat stood
      on his forehead, and his eyes were staring. And Leroux, who had struck
      upon a quieter vein of reminiscence, babbled on of the happy days of his
      love.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first thunder-clap had passed. Thought began to return. Sylvester sank
      into a chair and stared at the ground. The once clear vision of the past
      was distorted into a phantasmagoria of leering shapes. He shivered as with
      an ague, rubbed his eyes, and looked sharply at the man on the bed. Which
      of the two was delirious? Leroux raved of death and despair. The
      involuntary confession was too complete; mistake was impossible. Yet the
      other was impossible. Constance guilty of this hideousness? Her life a
      lie? The firm anchorage of his soul but shifting sand? He had worshipped
      her as more than woman,&mdash;as the purest, chastest thing that God had
      ever given to man for his guidance. It was a ghastly figment of Leroux's
      drink-besotted brain.
    </p>
    <p>
      He rose, went to the drawer in which he had locked Leroux's letter-case,
      and taking it out with shaking hands, deliberately turned the contents on
      to the corner of the chest. In spite of the revulsion of faith he had a
      sickening certainty of finding there what he hoped he would not find.
    </p>
    <p>
      There it was, staring him in the face amid a heap of stamps, visiting
      cards, pencilled memoranda slips, letters, and law papers: a soiled,
      crumpled letter in his dead wife's hand. He took it up, and from it
      dropped a lock of fair hair,&mdash;her hair. He read it through steadily.
      It was a letter of passionate love, leaving no doubt as to guilt; of
      despair, almost madness; such a letter of abandonment as a woman writes
      but to one man in a lifetime. It bore no date save the day of the week,&mdash;Wednesday.
      Even in his agony he contrasted the difference between this woman and the
      serene, methodical wife who would as soon have left a letter undated as
      the household dinner unordered. He threw the letter and the lock of hair
      into the fire, and watched the two little flames in the glowing coals. The
      paper curled, the hair writhed; then a little light ash remained.
    </p>
    <p>
      Methodically he replaced the cards and papers in the letter-case and
      locked it up again in the drawer. Then he stood at the foot of the bed and
      watched the man who had done him this great wrong, his brain on fire with
      bewildering fury. The name of his wife came again from the man's lips. A
      red cloud passed before Sylvester's eyes. For a moment he seemed to lose
      consciousness of manhood, to become a wild beast. When he recovered, he
      found himself glaring into Leroux's eyes with his fingers at his throat.
      How near he had been to murder he did not know.
    </p>
    <p>
      He drew himself up and wiped the sweat from his forehead, shaken to the
      depths by the beast impulse. The reaction brought self-control. He resumed
      his vigil by the bedside, listening grimly to the words of Leroux, now
      less frequent and distinct. Yet though he could master his actions, he did
      not combat with the increasing hatred that took the place of the old
      affection. At times he considered calmly whether such a man should be
      allowed to live. In his weak state one quick blow over the heart would
      stop its beating for ever. The man had done more than wrong him. He had
      killed his soul, made it an awful thing to live. Yet, as if in contempt of
      such imaginings, he rose once or twice and changed the bandages with a
      surgeon's delicate handling, and moistened the swollen lips with ice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gradually all the phases of realisation developed themselves in his mind.
      Far off memories recurred, touched the flesh. It was their marriage bed
      whereon Leroux was lying.
    </p>
    <p>
      He shuddered from the manifold horror of it, and for the first time broke
      into a hoarse cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Toward morning the fever lowered and Leroux lay still. Streaks of a
      ghostly daylight crept in through the Venetian blinds and barred the
      floor. The nurse came to take over her watch. Sylvester gave brief
      instructions, and, going to his room, threw himself on his bed and slept
      heavily. At the moment of waking he had a sense of nightmare, was all but
      congratulating himself on his release; but another instant brought the
      full flood of memory. He rose, shaved, dressed himself as usual, and went
      down to breakfast. At the bottom of the stairs was a quick patter of feet
      and two little arms were thrown around his limbs. It was Dorothy. He
      started back, looked at her stupidly. Then roughly disengaging her, he
      thrust her aside and hurried into the breakfast room. A new and sickening
      doubt convulsed him. Was she his child?
    </p>
    <p>
      She came in a while later, shyly holding by the maid-servant's skirts,
      regarding him with scared reproach. Never had her father been cross or
      rough. Ungentleness from him was incomprehensible to her child's mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Run away upstairs,&rdquo; he said, controlling his voice, then added to the
      servant, &ldquo;Take Miss Dorothy into the nursery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The child burst into tears, as the maid led her out. Tender-hearted a man
      as he was, for all the world he could not have called her back.

      CHAPTER V&mdash;DE MORTUIS
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">H</span>e received his
      patients in the consulting-room, visited Leroux, and went on his morning
      rounds. On his return, he perceived Ella at the gates of Woodlands. He
      raised his hat and was proceeding to turn into his own little carriage
      drive, when she made a gesture of arrest. He pulled up, descended from the
      trap, and went to meet her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is poor Mr. Leroux? we have all been so anxious. Of course the nurse
      has reported, but we wanted to know from you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid it's a serious matter,&rdquo; said Sylvester.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean that he may die?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Possibly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am so sorry,&rdquo; she said, laying a sympathetic touch on his arm. &ldquo;I know
      what a dear friend he was.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A dear friend,&rdquo; he assented grimly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are looking so fagged. You have been sitting up all night, I hear.
      Two nights.&rdquo; He confessed his vigils, explained Leroux's symptoms, and
      gave her an authoritative report for his father. If he found any material
      change since the morning, he would send a message across. The topic
      exhausted, there was a short silence. She tried to speak, after an
      embarrassed glance, but his sombreness daunted her. He was taking this
      danger of his friend greatly to heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are coming in to see Uncle Matthew some time to-day?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It depends upon my work,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I have a great deal to occupy me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With a word of adieu he left her and went into his own house. Ella passed
      through the gate of Woodlands and strolled slowly down the shrubbery walk,
      carrying a little burden of depression. For all his anxiety on Mr.
      Leroux's behalf, he might have made some reference to his letter, some
      allusion to the sweet and delicate suspense of their present relations.
      She felt vaguely disappointed at the lack of appeal to her sympathy. But
      her spirits revived when Matthew Lanyon, coming briskly home to lunch,
      overtook her and asked her in his cheery voice for news of the invalid.
      She took his arm in girlish fashion and gave him Sylvester's message.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He seems dreadfully distressed,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor old Syl! But he'll pull him through. He doesn't realise his own
      powers. I don't think we respect Syl half enough. He's a great physician,
      you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He rattled on, proud of his son, quite glad to have a pretty girl hanging,
      in that daughterly way, on his arm. He stopped now and then, pointing to
      the tiny green shoots on the trees. The fine weather of the last few days
      was the cause. Did Ella remember how black everything was only a week ago?
      He spoke as if it were a miracle performed for the first time and not the
      recurring phenomenon of a million springs. A thrush flew out of a laurel
      bush. He named it, followed it with his eyes to the elm where it alighted,
      stooped down and picked a snail from the middle of the gravel, where it
      might get crushed, and threw it lightly on the grass. The tender
      simplicities of the old man touched the girl deeply that afternoon, and
      his steady optimism made her feel ashamed of her misgivings. So the
      sunshine came into her heart again.
    </p>
    <p>
      But two days passed before they saw Sylvester. News came frequently.
      Leroux was sinking. At last Sylvester entered the library at the hour of
      tea and announced gravely,&mdash;&ldquo;He is dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Lanyon uttered a little cry, and tears flooded her eyes. Matthew held
      out his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm sorry, Syl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He died about half an hour ago,&rdquo; said Sylvester. &ldquo;He never recovered
      consciousness, so what were his last wishes God alone knows. I have put
      all his papers into a sealed envelope, which I had better hand over to
      you, father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Matthew took the packet in silence and locked it in a drawer of his
      writing-table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had better let me look after the funeral too, Syl,&rdquo; said he, kindly.
      &ldquo;It's the first chance I 've had of doing anything for the poor fellow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, father,&rdquo; said Sylvester.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Lanyon tearfully enumerated Leroux's virtues. What a frank,
      open-hearted, generous lad! And to be taken away, like this, in his prime!
      Who could fathom the will of God? Ella remained silent, grieved at
      Sylvester's loss. But he refused to meet the ready sympathy in her eyes,
      and looked stonily through the window on the grey March sky. Presently he
      turned away. To remain there longer was unendurable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have a patient to see, some way out. One mustn't neglect the living for
      the dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then for the first time he met Ella's glance, and a special application of
      his saying occurred to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye, all,&rdquo; he said, and strode hurriedly from the room. He drew a
      deep breath on reaching the open air. It was good to be alone, away from
      the torturing irony of sympathy. And it was good to be away from the
      foreshadowing of reproach in a woman's eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      That night, before he slept, he shut his teeth upon a horrible repulsion,
      and went into the death chamber to see that all things had been decently
      done. The man lay cold and pale, his jaws swathed and his eyes closed, an
      awful sphinx. Sylvester stood and gazed upon him till his heart grew as
      cold as the dead man's. It was well that he was dead, so that he could
      blab the disastrous secret no more. Sylvester had questioned the nurses
      discreetly. To his relief he had found that the delirious ravings had made
      no impression on their memories. He alone had been the confidant. He had
      tended the man with devoted skill. The strain of that terrible task was
      over. Now the dead past would bury its dead,&mdash;his own heart and youth
      therewith. He was glad the man would no longer cumber the earth&mdash;and
      he was glad that his wife was dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three days afterwards, Leroux was buried. A fussy elderly man, Leroux's
      cousin and sole surviving relative, shared with Sylvester the post of
      chief mourner, and departed into the unknown whence he came. Sylvester
      stood by the grave with a set, impassive face, and his father stood by his
      side, looking strangely like him. On the drive home it was Sylvester who
      exchanged a few courteous remarks with the cousin; but the old man
      remained singularly silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      They sat together alone that evening in the library.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leroux died intestate,&rdquo; said Matthew, breaking a long silence. &ldquo;He was in
      a troubled state of mind and was coming to me to help him with his will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He had been drinking heavily,&rdquo; said Sylvester.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I presumed so. He had roughed the will out. He only had a few thousands.
      But Dorothy was to have the greater part. I showed the draft to John
      Leroux to-day, who is a man of great wealth. He is desirous that his
      cousin's wishes should be carried out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can accept no gifts from Mr. John Leroux,&rdquo; said Sylvester.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man argued the point. Morally the money was Dorothy's. Sylvester
      listened stubbornly. He revolted at the thought of touching Leroux's
      money. It was a ghastly impossibility. He repeated,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot accept it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Money is money, Syl, after all; and I may not be able, perhaps, to do
      what I had hoped for Dorothy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;While my daughter bears my name I can support her decently. If Mr. Leroux
      will not benefit by what is legally his, he can devote it to charity. It
      is a matter of principle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were both inflexible men, and they understood each other's nature.
      Matthew did not press the point.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; he said in a business tone. &ldquo;I will tell Mr. Leroux of your
      decision.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the impassiveness of his tone was belied by the almost yearning
      earnestness with which he regarded his son, who sat staring into the fire.
      He would have given years of his own happiness to know whether a gnawing
      suspicion were baseless; but the question could not be put. Sylvester was
      silent. What troubles were at work behind his sombre brow the old man
      could not fathom; and Sylvester, though his heart was bursting, could not
      speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      How could he disclose, even to the being who now was dearest to him in the
      world, his wife's shame, his own dishonour? Better to keep the hideous
      fact locked up in his breast. But yet, if he could have found a rush of
      tumultuous words, what heart-ease were in it! So many, with that great
      gift of expansiveness, had come to his father and gone away comforted, and
      he, the son deeply loving and deeply loved, was powerless to utter a
      complaint. He bit his lip to repress a groan.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so it was all through the remainder of his residence in Ayresford. His
      relations with his father continued their old undemonstrative course. To
      please him, he assumed his wonted cheerfulness and spoke of matters
      political and parochial. And by degrees the old man forgot the cloud he
      had seen hanging over him and only thought of his approaching departure.
      Dorothy came to live at Woodlands, so as to grow accustomed to the change,
      said Sylvester, and he only saw her on his rare visits. He forced himself
      to be kind and take notice of her as formerly. But the sight of her was a
      great pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ella he avoided as much as possible, never seeing her alone. One day she
      was standing by the porch as he came up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is my father in?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He hasn't yet come back from the office.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will go and meet him there,&rdquo; he replied, and went away forthwith.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you and Syl quarrelled?&rdquo; asked Miss Lanyon, who had observed the
      scene from indoors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ella laughed; not a happy laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are behind the times, Aunt Agatha. Nowadays unceremoniousness is a
      proof of friendship.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should call it rudeness, my dear,&rdquo; said Miss Lanyon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's a proof of affection,&rdquo; said Ella.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she went quickly up to her room, lest the elder lady should see the
      angry tears that rose in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first she strove to explain away his change of attitude. Then she
      examined her own conduct, with a view to discover therein some possible
      cause. She could find none. A dull sense of pain and dread crept over her.
      What did it mean? He had kissed her, all but asked her to be his wife, and
      now, suddenly, he ignored her existence. The realisation of the fulness of
      her love for him smote her cruelly as she lay awake at night. She shrank,
      fearful-eyed, from the prospect of life without him. It stretched before
      her a dreary waste of futile years. Then the quick hope of youth came
      back. It was some foolish misunderstanding. Sylvester was worried,
      preoccupied, saddened. There were so many things to be reckoned with in
      the strenuous life of a man. He would speak, explain. All would be well.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the days passed and that of Sylvester's departure drew nigh. He had
      hurried it on. His successor had arrived, been introduced to the practice;
      no advantage could be gained by remaining at Ayresford, where all save his
      father was strangely hateful. Ella waited, but Sylvester never spoke nor
      looked her way. At last she could bear the mortifying suspense no longer.
      It was the evening before his departure. She was sitting with Miss Lanyon
      in the drawing-room after dinner, having left the two men below to their
      coffee and cigars. Her companion was silently knitting, her eyes somewhat
      dim, poor soul, at the prospect of Sylvester's absence. Ella went to the
      piano and tried to play, but her heart was not in the music. The men
      lingered downstairs. An hour passed. The silence and the aching of her own
      suspense acted on her nerves. Suddenly she left the room and went
      downstairs and opened the dining-room door. Both men rose as she stood on
      the threshold, a graceful figure, with heightened colour and eyes
      unusually bright.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to say something to Syl before he goes,&rdquo; she announced boldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here he is,&rdquo; said Matthew, coming forward. &ldquo;I was just going into the
      library for a little as you came in. No; really, Syl, I was. I'll join you
      upstairs when you have had your chat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You spoil me, Uncle Matthew,&rdquo; said the girl, touched, as she always was,
      by his old-fashioned courtesy. &ldquo;Why can't Syl and I go into the library?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I'm master in my own house, my dear,&rdquo; smiled the old man.
    </p>
    <p>
      He closed the door behind him. Sylvester motioned Ella to a chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I have not come to stay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was silent for a moment, looking at the tip of her slipper that rested
      on the fender.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have I done anything to offend you lately, Sylvester?&rdquo; she asked at
      length.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing that I am aware of,&rdquo; he answered gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We don't seem to be such good friends,&rdquo; she hazarded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure you must be mistaken.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The cold formality of the phrase was a knell to her hopes. She looked up
      somewhat piteously and met hard, unsympathetic eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought&mdash;you made me think&mdash;&rdquo; she began. He raised his hand
      slightly to check her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I did,&rdquo; he said coldly, &ldquo;I was wrong. I owe you all my apologies.&rdquo;
       There was a moment's silence. &ldquo;If I could say more, I would,&rdquo; he added.
    </p>
    <p>
      But a quickly gathering anger in the girl's heart suddenly broke out. She
      drew herself up, flaming-cheeked, with eyes flashing through the tears
      that would come.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have behaved horribly, cruelly, and I want never to see your face
      again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sylvester bowed his head. A swift rustle of skirts, a sound of the door,
      and she was gone. He raised his head and drew rather a choking breath. He
      knew that Ella had just cause for reproach. But what could be done? The
      new budding love had been killed outright. He regarded her with aversion,
      with something akin even to horror. And his heart was as cold as a stone.

    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>t was a Sunday in
      June, a year after Sylvester had come to London, and the great stretch of
      the Park, past Stanhope Gate, north of Achilles' statue, was thronged. The
      warm breath of the afternoon air scarcely stirred the leaves that
      chequered with shade and sunshine the mass of cool colour below. Above
      shone the vivid green of the foliage and the sea-blue of the sky; but
      beneath the branches the air was tempered by the reflection of the whites,
      the pale greys, the delicate blues and lavenders, and the soft pinks of
      dresses and parasols. It was the ordinary crowd that sat there, very
      fashionable, somewhat vulgar below the surface, but delicately
      picturesque, like human flower-beds in a sweet but formal garden. And on
      the walks beside and around and between passed the endless procession of
      loungers. The hum of talk, the subdued patter of footsteps, and the
      frou-frou of soft drapery hung upon the air.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sylvester sat in the sun at the edge of one of the parterres, flanked, on
      the one side, by an elderly matron chaperoning a line of laughing girls,
      and on the other by a white-moustached, red-faced Anglo-Indian laying down
      the law to a neighbour on the preparation of curry. Sylvester stared
      moodily at the parterre in front, separated from him by the pathway, and
      felt very lonely. Despite his loss of faith in man and woman, he hungered
      dumbly for the human companionship from which he shrank. The first sense
      of novelty over, his practice in London had failed to stimulate him. The
      interest was absorbing, but unthrilling. He began to realise that he was
      degenerating into a consulting and recording machine,&mdash;very
      sensitive, it is true, but a machine all the same. He lived alone in a
      formal house in Weymouth Street. In the morning he rose early, worked in
      his laboratory, saw patients, ate, saw more patients, worked again in his
      laboratory, ate, and till bedtime read or worked again among the endless
      test-tubes and retorts. And so, without change, day after day. His
      common-sense told him that it was not a healthy life for a human being.
      But how to alter it effectively save by mixing with his kind? And his kind
      was hateful to him. He had grown to be a recluse, misanthropically
      brooding over its worthlessness. Yet now and then, as today, instinct
      drove him into the crowd.
    </p>
    <p>
      He caught himself half envying the crowd's irresponsible gaiety. It was
      quite within his power, as far as external conditions were concerned, to
      become as one of those he saw and to surround himself with laughter-loving
      friends. He wondered vaguely what it would be like.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's the proportion of turmeric that does it,&rdquo; exclaimed his neighbour,
      in a more emphatic tone than he had hitherto used. &ldquo;The only man I knew
      that had the secret was poor old Jack Hilton&mdash;you remember Jack
      Hilton&mdash;of the Guides? He ran off with Mrs. Algy Broadbent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sylvester shivered slightly. A cloud came before his eyes. Were all men
      dishonourable and all women faithless? Was all this refined and nicely
      civilised crowd rotten to its soul? He looked furtively around. Who could
      tell what Messalina lurked beneath yonder girl's pink and white skin and
      innocent fresh eyes, what villainy and meanness lay concealed beneath
      yonder young soldier's specious bearing of manliness? Disgust banished the
      haunting envy.
    </p>
    <p>
      A man who had been chattering to the girls on his left took leave of them
      with a great sweep of his hat. In the act of passing Sylvester, he stopped
      short and regarded him as though in astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Trône de l'air!</i> and by all the oaths of the vehement South, what
      are you doing here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you do, Roderick?&rdquo; said Sylvester, rising and formally shaking
      hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I'm bursting with fatness, which is more than I can say for you. But
      what are you doing in this galley?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why shouldn't I be here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The eternal fitness of things. One doesn't as a general rule, for
      instance, meet the Archbishop of Canterbury at a Covent Garden ball.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He spoke in a hearty voice, with somewhat exotic gestures. Roderick Usher
      had spent part of his schooldays in France, and was fond of insisting on
      his cosmopolitan training. He was dressed in the most perfectly fitting of
      frock-coats and patent leather boots, and wore faultless grey suede
      gloves. His only departure from the commonplace severity of fashionable
      attire was a yellow Indian silk bow whose ends spread over the front of
      his coat. He had light fuzzy hair that protruded bushily behind his glossy
      silk hat, and his yellow beard was pointed in the Vandyke pattern. He was
      of medium height, rather stout; his face was broad and ruddy, at first
      sight giving the impression of frank good humour; but his eyes, small and
      somewhat shifty, although hidden behind gold pince-nez, detracted from the
      general air of handsomeness that he was pleased to cultivate. Besides, the
      deep lines of nearing middle age were growing troublesomely obvious.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sylvester replied in a matter-of-fact way to his last remark,&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was working in my laboratory all the morning, and I felt the need of
      air. Weymouth Street is not far. I don't come here as a rule.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bless you, my friend, there's no need to apologise. The place belongs to
      you just as much as it does to me. How's the old man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which old man?&rdquo; asked Sylvester.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your old man, my old man, both our old men. Our antique but venerated old
      men.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My father is very well,&rdquo; replied Sylvester, stiffly, &ldquo;and so, I believe,
      is yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>A la bonne heure!</i> So you've come to London to make your fortune?
      You steady scientific files always do. We poor artistic devils generally
      manage to make other people's.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't quite understand,&rdquo; said Sylvester.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other laughed and drawing a cigarette from a silver case lit it
      daintily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't suppose you do. You approach a paradox as solemnly as if it were
      a disease. We play bat and ball with it. That makes the difference between
      us. Have a turn?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sylvester assented somewhat reluctantly. He disliked the son as much as he
      disliked the father. But the spirit of lonesomeness had been weighing on
      him to-day, and human instinct craved relief. They moved away and took
      their places in the sauntering procession on the broad walk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don't you do more of this sort of thing?&rdquo; asked Roderick. &ldquo;You treat
      life by rule of thumb, as if it were a science. It isn't; it's an art,&mdash;the
      finest of the Fine Arts. Colour, form, relief, action, sound,
      articulation, all combined, capable of a myriad permutations, any one of
      which can be fixed by the inspiration of the moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My way of life suits me best,&rdquo; replied Sylvester. &ldquo;I teach people how to
      kill bacilli; you teach them how to kill time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Time's a deadlier enemy than all your bacilli, my friend, and takes a
      devilish sight more killing. But we won't argue. Argument is a discord in
      the symphony of existence. Besides, it's too confoundedly hot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here he bowed in his grand style to a passing lady acquaintance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ideals can exist outside of little glass bottles, my dear Sylvester,&rdquo; he
      resumed. &ldquo;Perhaps you may be surprised at hearing I am approaching the
      attainment of one of the ideals of my maturing years. It's a great scheme
      for the purification of art and the ennoblement of life. It is my own
      conception. Have you been to the Royal Academy yet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Sylvester. &ldquo;I haven't had the time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Happy man! You have been spared a soul-rending spectacle of England's
      utter degradation. In all our art&mdash;drama, music, painting, poetry,
      architecture&mdash;it is the same. The vulgarity of commercialism, the
      banality of meretricious prettiness, the hand and brain working
      mechanically while the soul is far away wallowing in pounds, shillings and
      pence, or following a golf ball, or philandering in my Lady's boudoir. The
      true artist is suffocated. But we 're going to change all that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How are you going to manage it?&rdquo; asked Sylvester, with polite
      indifference.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, that's my secret. A great and glorious scheme just on the point of
      ripening. We are going to catch our artists young, painters, musicians,
      poets, the whole celestial brood, and keep them out of contamination,&mdash;give
      them free elemental surroundings for their art to develop. They will
      become the teachers and the guides of the race. To carry this dream
      through to a reality is something to live for,&mdash;to make one feel
      twenty again, with all one's glittering illusions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are going to carry it through?&rdquo; said Sylvester.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My boy, I should just think I am,&rdquo; replied Roderick, taking his arm
      confidentially. &ldquo;Funds have been slow in coming in, but people are
      promising support, now that they see the magnificence of the concern. I'll
      send you our prospectus and other publications. You can judge for
      yourself. Perhaps your father would like to further the work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'd better ask him,&rdquo;, said Sylvester, drily. &ldquo;But where does the money
      go to?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the Colony. Didn't I tell you it was to be a colony? The Walden Art
      Colony. After a time it will be self-supporting; the produce will sell in
      the European and American markets, and the Colony will wax rich. It will
      become the world's great Palace of Art.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How will this fit in with Thoreau and uncontaminated nature?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sylvester put the question idly. He took faint interest in Roderick's
      iridescent scheme, which seemed to have no bearing upon the realities of
      life, as he understood them. But he could not help wondering as to the
      mental attitude of the fools who were providing the money to launch it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's too complicated to explain now,&rdquo; replied Roderick. &ldquo;You read the
      literature I shall send you.&rdquo; He pulled out his watch. &ldquo;Dear me! it is ten
      minutes to six, and I promised to meet Lady Milmo and Miss Defries at the
      quarter by the statue. They are my two most enthusiastic disciples. Shall
      we turn and seek them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think not,&rdquo; said Sylvester. &ldquo;I'm too dull a dog for fashionable dames.
      I should be a discord in the polka, or whatever you call it, of
      existence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Roderick laughed with good-humoured indulgence, showing a set of white,
      even teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The same old <i>intransigeant</i>,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Well, go your ways. I'll
      convert you to the Colony yet, and make you a director! <i>Auf
      wiedersehen!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sylvester shook hands with him in his glum style and strolled on towards
      the Marble Arch, glad to be winning homewards again away from the froth of
      fashion and the jargon of art. He smiled once on his way. It was at the
      idea of his father, shrewd-headed abhorrer of cranks, putting his hands in
      his pockets for the Walden Art Colony. Not while there was a lazy
      miscreant with wife and children in Ayresford, he thought. How could a man
      of the world like Roderick imagine him to be such a fool?
    </p>
    <p>
      But Roderick, with his cheery air of confidence, followed the southward
      stream of people.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do, Usher?&rdquo; said a young man, passing by.
    </p>
    <p>
      Roderick stopped him. &ldquo;My dearest boy, I haven't been able to see you to
      shake you by the hand. The play's immense, colossal. You've marked a new
      era,&mdash;the Marlowe of our time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good of you to say so,&rdquo; murmured the dramatic author.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is my most esteemed privilege,&rdquo; said Roderick, and waving an adieu
      with his well-gloved hand, he went on his way to Lady Milmo.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the corner he looked about for a moment, and not seeing her sat down
      and waited. He gazed on the soft blue sky and stroked his pointed beard,
      letting his thoughts wander whither they would.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am so sorry, Mr. Usher,&rdquo; said a voice. He started to, his feet; Lady
      Milmo and Ella were before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A thousand pardons. I was gathering the wool of sweet and bitter fancy!
      Oh, no, you are not late, indeed not. Won't you sit? It is somewhat
      deserted here, but it is more rural than further up; we can talk more
      freely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure you can talk interestingly anywhere,&rdquo; said Lady Milmo.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was a small elderly lady dressed somewhat youthfully. She wore a
      little rouge, a trifle of black along the eyelashes, and a coquettish
      straw hat with pink roses and an osprey feather. She seemed thoroughly
      contented with herself and her surroundings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One gets into the habit of talking in the key of one's environment,&rdquo; said
      Roderick, reflectively. &ldquo;Don't you think so, Miss Defries?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the fault of this social life of ours,&rdquo; replied Ella. &ldquo;There are so
      many affectations and insincerities around us that we are afraid to be
      genuine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a great charm of Lady Milmo and yourself that with you one is bound
      to be genuine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do like people to appear just as they are,&rdquo; smiled Lady Milmo.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is what we are working for,&rdquo; said Roderick; &ldquo;the return to sincerity
      and simple truth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what have you to tell us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good news. Raynham has come round, and will take a seat on the Council.
      He may get a couple more Academicians. One further item in my debt of
      gratitude to you, Miss Defries.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is very little I have been able to do,&rdquo; said Ella. &ldquo;I only asked Mr.
      Raynham to receive you. Your own earnestness and conviction won him over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An old gentleman came up and spoke to Lady Milmo. Roderick politely
      yielded him his chair and took possession of a vacant one on the other
      side of Ella.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is your womanly sympathy and courage all through that I have to thank;
      your cheering in depression, your encouragement in the face of defeat. If
      the star of success has arisen, it is you who have dispersed the obscuring
      clouds. A man may set his heart on a thing, but a woman keeps it there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He spoke in a low voice, and Ella leaned towards him to listen. Her cheeks
      flushed. The flattery was sweet, and there was a subtle vibration in his
      voice that stirred her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One would die if there were not something noble to live for,&rdquo; said she,
      suddenly throwing off the stealing languor. &ldquo;To rise every morning and
      look forward to sixteen inevitable waking hours that will not bring one
      throb to the pulses, one inspiring hope; to go to sleep each night feeling
      dull and useless, and so on for endless months and years,&mdash;it is an
      unlivable life. It is you I have to thank for putting an interest in my
      way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I love to hear you speak like that,&rdquo; he said admiringly. &ldquo;Pray God you
      keep your enthusiasms; There are thousands who never know the thrill. It
      should be part of our mission to awaken their souls. There is one friend
      of ours, for instance, who needs it to make him a great man. Oddly enough,
      I have just left him&mdash;dear old Sylvester Lanyon, you know. I found
      him sitting a little higher up, looking like a sick raven among birds of
      paradise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her clear girl's eyes effected feminine concealment of the old pain that
      every reference to Sylvester had caused her for the past year. Her heart
      rebelled against it, resenting the inefficacy of time to cure. Wantonly
      she ignored it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not set eyes on him since he settled in town. He never comes to
      see us. He is still mourning and moping, I suppose. The world is for the
      living, not the dead; don't you think so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. He should marry again. A woman of exuberant vitality, who would
      carry him along with her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll have to find him a wife, Mr. Usher,&rdquo; she replied gaily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus she proved to herself defiantly that all her foolish feeling for
      Sylvester was dead; that she had also attained a standpoint of generous
      forgetfulness of wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And send him out with her to doctor the Colony,&rdquo; laughed Roderick. &ldquo;It
      would be the making of him. As it is, he is a man of fine honour and
      strong character. Even if one's own spiritual horizon is wider than that
      bounded by his narrow orthodoxy, yet one can but admire the steadfastness
      with which he keeps within its limits. I have always had, as you know, a
      great affection for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl's responsive nature was touched by the generous tribute. Roderick
      took a sudden leap in her esteem. She had her own haunting and miserable
      ideas as to Sylvester's honour, but the praise pleased her,&mdash;the fact
      of a man's loyalty to the ideal of a friend. At least, so she half
      consciously analysed her feelings.
    </p>
    <p>
      The talk went on, and time passed. Lady Milmo's friend departed and
      mingled in the stream that began to make for Hyde Park Corner and home.
      She turned to Ella and Roderick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The dear, tiresome general has been entertaining me with his corns while
      I have been dying to hear all about the Colony. And now it's too late. You
      must come soon and see us, Mr. Usher. It is useless to try to talk here.
      Why didn't we say Battersea? I'm afraid we 're sad creatures of
      convention.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Defries will make an adequate report, I am sure,&rdquo; said Roderick.
      &ldquo;But Raynham's accession to the cause was my main item of news.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They all rose and walked to Hyde Park Corner. There he saw the ladies into
      a cab and swept one of his elaborate bows as they drove off. But he
      remained for some moments on the curb in front of the Park gates absently
      watching the hansom until it was lost amid the traffic.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; he said half aloud, &ldquo;I wonder.&rdquo; And he walked slowly up
      Piccadilly, his eyes bent on the pavement, his hands behind him, with the
      air of a man in deep and somewhat harassed thought.

      CHAPTER VII&mdash;THE DANGEROUS HOUR
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span> few days
      afterwards Ella was lying on a sofa in her aunt's drawing-room in Pont
      Street. It was a hot afternoon, the windows were open, and the sun blinds
      tempered the light. Between their edges and the tops of the flowers in the
      window-boxes she could see a great band of golden sunshine. Having been to
      a late dance the evening before and to a stuffy but advanced picture
      exhibition in the morning, she was feeling physically languid, and glad to
      be excused from attendance on Lady Milmo, who was indefatigably attending
      a charitable committee. In her hand she held a letter that had come by the
      early afternoon post. It was from Matthew Lanyon, bright and gossipy on
      the surface, but her quick perception divined an undercurrent of sadness.
      He was looking forward to her promised visit in August. If only he could
      persuade Syl to come down too, it would be quite like old times. But
      perhaps it would be better for Syl to get right away among the Swiss
      mountains, as he proposed. There was nothing like a complete change for a
      jaded Londoner. He had come down for a week-end lately and was looking
      fagged and overworked. The garden had never been lovelier. The
      rhododendrons were out and all a mass of bumble-bees; he had never seen so
      many in his life. He was writing late at night, on his knees in the
      library. Dorothy had made a complicated web of Berlin wool all over his
      writing-chair, by way of fitting it up as a carriage for her doll, which
      was throned in the midst, and of course he had not dared to disturb it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I make an average grandfather,&rdquo; he wrote, &ldquo;but I do wish some one
      had given me a few lessons as to how to become a mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The fragrance of the country garden stole elusively upon the hot London
      room, and awakened a longing to get away from the glare and chatter into
      the cool quietude of Woodlands; to exchange the heavy dinnerparty where
      she was due in a few hours' time, with its heavy hot-house flowers and its
      artificial talk, for the peaceful summer evening in the summer-house under
      the trees, in the company of the dear old man, so sane, so sincere, and of
      Miss Lanyon, whose gentle mind seemed to have lain in lavender. She was
      tired; her heart was tired. The beautiful world lay hidden behind a
      mountain, up which she was climbing wearily, vainly. Her feet were tangled
      in an inextricable maze and her steps were devious. Where could she find a
      guide? She conjured up the picture of the old man's kind, grave smile, and
      longed, as only a girl can who is enmeshing her life, to throw herself
      down by his knees and open all her heart. Had he appeared at that moment
      at the door, she would have arisen and with a cry, half sob, half welcome,
      have thrown her arms about his neck and burst into tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If only he could come!&rdquo; she said, and she sank vaguely into the imagined
      solace. But what could she say to him? The formulated query crystallised
      her thoughts into chill dismay. How could she make known, even to him, the
      humiliation of that last interview with Sylvester, expose to him the
      nakedness of her outraged pride? She shrank from the thought. And the
      history of the year's follies? No. Never. She crumpled the letter fiercely
      in her hand. Then, suddenly repenting of her violence, she smoothed the
      sheet tenderly and kissed it and slipped it into the bosom of her dress.
    </p>
    <p>
      The year's follies. In this hour of lassitude and depression&mdash;rare to
      Ella, but common to all her sex, coming to woman with rhythmic iteration
      as inevitable as the tides&mdash;they rose up one by one before her, and
      her cheeks burned with shame. First it was Lionel Kavanagh, the poet and
      aesthetic critic. She had been reckless, craving excitement, forgetfulness
      of her burning humiliation. All through the season a year ago, she had
      flirted with him, openly, outrageously. He was one of Lady Milmo's
      menagerie, and used to sprawl on the hearth-rug and alternate rhapsody
      with mordant wit. And alone in her company he would sail perilously near
      the wind with sensuous allusiveness, until one day he grew bold and
      brought her a sonnet frankly sensual. She tore the manuscript into tiny
      pieces during an ominous silence, and ordered him out of the house. The
      next was Bertie Hetherington, who made violent love to her at
      Aix-les-Bains, whither she had been led by Lady Milmo's wandering fancy
      and rheumatic tendencies. He was a fresh, wholesome young Briton in a
      Hussar regiment. The vehemence of his devotion was sweet to Ella, and she
      kept him hoping longer than she knew was right. Perhaps if he had
      possessed more brains she might have married him. But when he wrote her an
      impassioned letter in which he affirmed that his heart <i>beet</i> only
      for her, the spelling caught the humorous side of Ella's fancy and she
      laughed herself out of her entanglement. Yet she had wronged him, just as
      Sylvester had wronged her, and she had wronged herself. The fresh bloom of
      her maidenhood had gone. Her sensitive pride magnified the taint.
    </p>
    <p>
      In London once more, the need of an occupation, an aim, a purpose,
      tormented her. She had tried the ignoble and found it bitter. She craved
      the higher plane of devotion to a cause, something elevated, impersonal.
      The ordinary pursuits that call forth a woman's self-sacrifice did not
      appeal to the unrest of her imagination. Besides, her young blood rebelled
      against self-suppression. In the stress and storm she caught at the first
      thing to her hand: Roderick Usher's Utopian scheme for the regeneration of
      art and the consequent purification of society. She was carried away like
      a straw on the crest of his vehement pro-pagandism. From an occasional
      attendant at her aunt's receptions, he became a regular visitor. Together
      they elaborated the scheme, discussed the details. She worked with him in
      obtaining supporters and canvassing for subscriptions. At first the
      correspondence, the interviewing, the plotting and intriguing, kept her
      enthusiastically occupied. She made converts among the young artists and
      poets who came to the house, inveighing against the tame formalism on the
      one hand and the morbid exaggeration on the other that were the curses of
      modern art. She attended meetings in fashionable drawing-rooms and
      expounded her theories. Notoriety followed her doings. A weekly paper
      published an illustrated interview with the priestess of the new gospel.
    </p>
    <p>
      She believed in the scheme. It was audacious, but practical. It was
      impossible for convincing art to flourish in the midst of the social
      insincerity and commercialism of the day. The teachers of men must lead a
      higher life than the taught; to have authority, must dwell aloof from the
      world; to have inspiration, must draw it from the pure wells of nature and
      their own hearts. These postulates being allowed, the logical consequence
      was the conception of a colony of earnest and devoted artists in some
      sequestered spot where the world's Babel came but as an echo. Such a spot
      was readily obtainable in California. A large ranch, in one of the
      loveliest valleys of the Sierra Nevada, was for sale. Extensions could be
      built indefinitely at a comparatively trifling cost. Thither the band of
      youths and maidens, uncorrupted as yet by the deadening influences around
      them, would proceed, and settling down would allow to flow unchecked the
      genuine founts of their genius. They would be in Arcadian ignorance of the
      arch destroyer of art, the public taste, and thus be beyond the reach of
      the temptation to pander to it. They would reveal the truth as it came
      crystallised in song or poem or picture from their own souls. The lack of
      pence would not disturb their serenity. Those who could afford it would
      pay a modest monthly contribution to the general fund. The penniless
      children of genius would obtain free food, shelter, and all the privileges
      of the Colony. The subscriptions of the supporters of the movement in
      England would defray their expenses. A commission would be levied on the
      profits of any work produced in the Colony. This, in the course of years,
      when public taste was revolutionised and the Waldenites' productions
      obtained great prices, would place the Colony beyond the need of
      subscriptions or of contributions by members. It would become, in
      Roderick's words, &ldquo;The world's great Palace of Art.&rdquo; Roderick himself was
      ready to sacrifice his future in London so as to take up the post of
      director of the Colony at a handsome salary.
    </p>
    <p>
      She believed in the scheme still; success, in fact, justified her faith.
      But in this hour of self-abasement she distrusted the sincerity of her
      enthusiasm. How much had she done genuinely for the cause? How much,
      unconsciously, for the man? The question racked her. He had woven his
      influence around her life. Her name was publicly associated with his. She
      dreaded meeting him, yet felt the heart taken out of the day on which she
      was not working under his direction. Whither was she tending? She could
      not answer. Not where happiness would lie. To have brought herself into
      this morass was the last and greatest of the year's follies. In her
      helpless anger she hated the scheme and all that she had done to further
      it. A sickening surmise as to its futility overspread her retrospect.
    </p>
    <p>
      She clasped her hands over her hot eyes and again longed for Woodlands.
      Suddenly she sprang to her feet, and smoothed her dress and hair
      hurriedly, as if ashamed of her nervelessness. She would write to Matthew
      Lanyon then and there, yield herself wholly to her need of expansion, and
      let what would flow from her pen. She sat down resolutely at the
      ornamental escritoire and drew out writing materials. She had never given
      him any definite account of the scheme. She had alluded to it vaguely,
      somewhat flippantly, partly anxious to amuse and partly fearful of
      criticism. The mention of Roderick Usher's name had been rare. She had
      followed the secretive instinct of her sex. The old man's references
      hitherto had been jocular; deceived by her manner, he had merely regarded
      her interest as an idle young woman's harmless hobby. Even in this letter
      that she carried crumpled in her bosom, he had asked her how her artistic
      Robinson Crusoes were getting on. He should know the history of the whole
      movement, her own hopes and fears,&mdash;perhaps more of her difficulties.
      She would write whatever words came into her mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      She dipped her pen in the ink, dashed off the date and &ldquo;My darling Uncle
      Matthew,&rdquo; and was starting the text of the letter, when the door opened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Usher, miss,&rdquo; announced the parlour maid.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ella closed her blotter with a petulant snap, but rose and greeted her
      visitor with a smile. Roderick looked cool and point-device in a grey
      frock-coat suit. A slight baldness in front gave his high forehead an air
      of intellectuality. He had called, he informed her, just to report
      progress. And as he talked she sat, her chin resting on her knuckles,
      watching him with that wistful gaze that comes from a woman's weary
      uncertainties.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, that is all,&rdquo; he said in conclusion; &ldquo;and I am glad there's no
      more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; asked Ella.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because you want a holiday,&mdash;a respite from the worry of affairs.
      Enthusiasms entail an expenditure of vital force; so there are times when
      the temperament is at a low ebb, and ought to be treated with gentle
      indulgence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think I am at low ebb, Mr. Usher?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are tired,&mdash;a little <i>mal de vivre</i>. Isn't it so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He said it so kindly that her first impulse of resentment died away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you know I'm not simply physically out of sorts? I was dancing
      till four this morning and till three the morning before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He smiled with a touch of indulgent superiority.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As a sailor who knows the sea reads all its moods on its surface, so I
      read yours in your eyes. Confess. You have been feeling the burthen of
      life and have not known whence came its heaviness; and you have been
      longing for relief in the fresh, cool arms of Mother Nature.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; she said, looking away from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not offended?&rdquo; he said, after a pause. He had a very musical
      voice, trained to modulation of feelings. &ldquo;My heart is always near my lips
      and at times speaks indiscreetly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ella turned round with a short laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I am not offended. Of course not. But it was scarcely fair to turn me
      inside out like that without warning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Immediately she regretted her confession. His acute perception had half
      flattered, half frightened her. She felt now that she had yielded some of
      her ground. She strove to regain it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it's all nonsense,&rdquo; she added. &ldquo;And very contemptible, just because
      it's a close day, with a stuffy dinner-party looming ahead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Phases of morale are never nonsense,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;No one knows what
      unrest is better than I. We must find the remedy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you suggest?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Happiness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is happiness?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The pursuit of the ideal on the wings of&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dare I say it&mdash;in all delicacy? Of love.&rdquo; Ella again turned her face
      aside, uncertain whether to resent the implication or to make a light
      answer. Her hesitation was his opportunity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I, too, have been feeling depressed of late,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;All pleasure has
      in time to be paid for with pain. In a few months our scheme will be
      launched,&mdash;the scheme that you and I have built up with pieces of our
      hearts,&mdash;and I shall go away to end my life in carrying out its
      working. I shall be alone. My helper and sweet comrade will no longer be
      by my side. Thus I, too, sigh for happiness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He smiled sadly, but she saw that his eyes were regarding her keenly from
      behind his gold pince-nez.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We won't think of that,&rdquo; she said hastily. &ldquo;So many things may happen
      between then and now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Roderick rose, rested his hand on the back of her chair, and bent over
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One thing might happen that would fill the months with glory, and
      inaugurate our project in the radiance of the rising sun. Yet not for the
      scheme's sake, but for our lives' sake&mdash;for the sake of the expansion
      and development of all that is yearning within us to find utterance&mdash;Ella&mdash;Will
      you come with me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She sat, looking straight before her, her lips apart, her body slightly
      swaying. Words would not come. She vaguely wished that something could
      happen to rid her of his presence, that he could disappear, there and
      then, once for all, out of her life. Yet she felt it impossible to dismiss
      him. Some mysterious feminine chord had been struck whose echoes
      proclaimed his right to stand over her and speak to her thus.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you saying?&rdquo; she murmured, with an almost piteous emphasis on
      the last word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am telling you that I love you, Ella, that my life is bound up in you,
      that I need you for the accomplishment of my manhood. And I am asking you
      to come with me to this sweet new land, to be my helper and my star. Say
      that you will come with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give me time,&rdquo; she breathed. &ldquo;I can't say&mdash;I have been living in a
      whirl so long. I don't know what I am or think or feel. I will give you an
      answer some day&mdash;soon&mdash;not now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will wait devotedly for your answer,&rdquo; said Roderick, in his courtliest
      manner, and moved a pace or two from her chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ella looked up at him, almost grateful for his assurance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will fix no period,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;To have to give such a reply by a
      definite date&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not ask it,&rdquo; said Roderick, quietly, though his heart was beating
      fast at the certainty of victory.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have given me the food of hope, whereon I can live meanwhile.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Could you not bear suspense?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;I might not answer as you would
      like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could bear anything for your sake,&rdquo; said he. Then, after a pause, &ldquo;And
      now goodbye. I must have solitude to dream over my happiness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She gave him her hand; he bent over it and kissed it, and she felt his
      lips hot against her skin. It gave her a little shudder of repugnance, and
      the feeling remained after he had gone. And yet his fascination was strong
      upon her. He dominated her will as no man had done before. She was
      conscious that he had the rare power to penetrate to the core of her
      woman's weaknesses, to understand her as a botanist understands a plant,
      and the rarer power to touch the fibres delicately, so that it became a
      pleasure to be weak. Again, her somewhat exaggerated conception of his
      wide spiritual and intellectual horizon moved her emotional temperament to
      wondering respect, and she thought gratefully of the expansion of her own
      under his influence. With the incomplete vision wherewith the wisest of
      women must of necessity regard a man, she saw him strong and masterful,
      clearing his way resolutely to a definite end. She felt that he brought
      this air of mastery into his love; and he had created a need of him within
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      He held her bound by many chains. And as she stood in the drawing-room,
      half-consciously rubbing the spot on her hand where his lips had rested,
      she felt the chains grow tighter, one by one.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her maid came into the room. &ldquo;When will you dress, miss?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She remembered the dinner-party and gave her directions. She wished that
      she had not to attend it. And then unbidden came the longing for &ldquo;the
      sweet new land&rdquo; with its freedom and freshness, and her cheeks flamed at
      the sudden realisation of what it all implied.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her glance fell upon the blotter in which lay the just commenced letter to
      Matthew Lanyon. She sat down again at the escritoire and took up her pen.
      But the mood had passed. She found herself writing artificially, in the
      jargon of her set. Angrily she tore up the paper and threw the fragments
      into the waste-paper basket. No; better nothing than the insincerity he
      despised; she loved him too dearly for that. So the letter, that was to
      reveal her inmost struggling self, remained unwritten.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was very silent as Lady Milmo and herself drove to the dinner-party.
      Her head ached and her limbs were tired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The man who takes me down will over-eat himself dreadfully,&rdquo; she
      remarked, as the carriage pulled up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't think there is any danger,&rdquo; replied her aunt, who was a woman of
      experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      And she was justified; for the girl's youth asserted itself, and as the
      meal progressed the headache was forgotten and Ella enjoyed herself
      thoroughly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I rather think your partner will want some supper, poor man,&rdquo; said Lady
      Milmo, on the homeward journey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's his own fault; he would talk,&rdquo; said Ella, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Milmo patted her niece's knee affectionately.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I love to see you getting all that enjoyment out of life, my dear. You
      seem to take it out in great chunks, like my neighbour this evening
      helping himself to iced pudding.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ella thought of her enjoyment with a whimsical feeling of shame, a touch
      of disappointment at not being as jaded as she had expected. But with the
      quiet darkness of the night her conflict of doubts returned. After all,
      what trivial topics she had discussed, what inanities she had laughed at,
      what spiteful little shafts of malice she had flung. If she had enjoyed
      it, so much the worse spiritually and morally for herself. Oh, the past
      year! It had corrupted her. She looked back wistfully upon the girl whom
      Sylvester had kissed at Woodlands. That fresh, shy, sweet something she
      had given him then was hers no longer to give to any man. What she could
      give to Roderick Usher, if she yielded to him, she did not know;
      certainly, not that.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was very young, very much unversed in the dark and crooked ways of
      life, in spite of her experience of men and things; intensely eager to
      keep herself pure and proud, to love the highest when she saw it. It is
      not to be set down to weakness, therefore, if she grew very sorry for the
      girl whom Sylvester had kissed, and cried herself miserably to sleep.

      CHAPTER VIII&mdash;TRIUMPH
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he facilities that
      London offers as a hiding-place are proverbial. A man in good position may
      disappear entirely from his friends and yet be living for many years as a
      grocer's assistant half a mile away. But when two acquaintances who belong
      to the same social class have no particular reasons for lying hidden, they
      are bound sooner or later to meet. Now Sylvester and Ella had not set eyes
      on each other since the eve of the former's departure from Ayres-ford,
      when he had said things which Ella firmly believed at the time had broken
      her heart. This was not unnatural, seeing that he held rigidly aloof from
      the society in which Ella moved. Neither did he frequent theatres nor
      operas nor picture galleries, nor places of public resort. But he went
      this year to the Ladies' Soirée of the Royal Society, first, because he
      had been unable to attend the sterner masculine assembly of the former
      evening, and, secondly, because he desired to meet two or three scientists
      of European reputation who he knew would be there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Milmo, who went everywhere and was proud of taking everywhere her
      beautiful niece, was at the soirée also with Ella. Their progress through
      the rooms was slow, as they knew many people, and the crowd was great.
      Suddenly Lady Milmo pulled Ella's arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear me, if that isn't Sylvester Lanyon!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ella looked instinctively in the indicated direction, and as her eyes fell
      upon him, her heart gave a great throb. He was in earnest conversation
      with an elderly man who wore an order of some kind, enforcing his
      argument, according to a familiar trick of his, with the forefinger of one
      hand and the palm of the other. His brown, intellectual face and well-knit
      figure marked him as a man of some distinction. To Ella's dismay he
      appeared to her the one distinguished personality in the room. His face
      had grown more worn than she remembered it, and his hair greyer at the
      temples. She found herself pitying him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; said Lady Milmo, &ldquo;I'm going to give him a good talking to.&rdquo; Before
      Ella could resist she had adroitly edged through the press and arrived
      within his reach, Ella following mechanically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Dr. Lanyon, fancy meeting you here. Ella and I have jars and jars of
      pickled rods for you. Why do you never come near us? Is it because we 're
      so aggravatingly healthy?&rdquo; Sylvester murmured an apology. Indeed, he had
      no reasons to offer. Lady Milmo was an old friend. He confessed his
      rudeness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame,&rdquo; said Sylvester's companion, with a low bow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Professor Steinthal! I didn't know you were in London. Forgive me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned to speak to him as Ella and Sylvester confronted each other.
      Ella put out her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope you are well,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite well; and you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ought to be able to judge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You seem to be in good health,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;What maladies may lurk beneath
      the surface, I cannot tell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't suppose you can,&rdquo; she was tempted to say. She saw that he
      understood, but he made no reply, and there was an awkward pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm going to see Uncle Matthew in August,&rdquo; she said at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I have heard. I'm going to Switzerland, so I shall not have the
      pleasure of meeting you. Do you know many people here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The pointed banality of the question angered her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you never have a kind word to say to me?&rdquo; she flashed out in a quick
      undertone, then she turned and greeted the professor effusively.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, whatever wild, uncontrollable hopes were newly born at the first
      sight of him, they were frozen at once to death. She went home in a
      furious rage of humiliation. He was a man of ice and steel, an automaton
      equipped with an intellect, scarcely a man at all. She put an imperious
      end to her doubts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Roderick Usher called next day, and spoke as one inspired with lofty
      ideals. Before her fascinated vision he seemed to place realities where
      hitherto the void had yawned or shadows at the most had shimmered. Life
      stretched infinitely in front of her, a lush garden, fertile with a myriad
      beauties. Her expanding soul shone out of dewy eyes. All the blindness,
      all the weakness, all the deluded nobility of her nature, lay revealed,
      pathetically defenceless. It was Roderick's golden hour, when he knew that
      he had her at his mercy.
    </p>
    <p>
      He rose, flung out his arms in a passionate gesture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come to me, Ella. Our destinies demand it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She too rose and faced him, her eyes shining like stars, and held out her
      hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I will come,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Roderick went into the warm June sunshine, thrilled with triumph, holding
      his head high. He walked along heedless of direction, turned into Hans
      Place and completed an entire circuit of the gardens before he realised
      what he had done. He paused, to think of some destination. Then he laughed
      aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Roderick, you must be in love,&rdquo; he said to himself. A long struggle with
      fortune had rendered it a rare occurrence for Roderick not to be perfectly
      aware of what he was doing and of what he was about to do. But the victory
      had come sooner than he had anticipated, and his immediate scheme of life,
      was thrown into confusion. He turned to the right, and once in Sloane
      Street, wandered north and found himself again undetermined at the corner
      of the Brompton Road. The driver of a crawling hansom touched his hat
      inquiringly. It was a brand-new, summer season cab, with horse and driver
      well turned out, and it caught his fancy. He stood upon the step, looked
      east, looked west, up and down the surging thoroughfare. Then obeying a
      sudden impulse, he shouted laughingly an address over the hood of the cab,&mdash;&ldquo;24
      Weymouth Street.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He would go and present himself to an astonished Sylvester, acquaint him
      with his good fortune, and perhaps learn certain things concerning which
      delicacy had forbidden him to make too close inquiries. At any rate, there
      was a certain attractive impudence in the adventure. He lit a cigar and
      lay back on the soft cushions of the cab and regarded himself complacently
      in the strip of mirror. He was wearing well, he thought, as he caressed
      his Vandyke beard, and appeared by no means an unromantic lover. The
      deepening crows' feet about his eyes gave him a momentary uneasiness, but
      he parted his lips, and by way of compensation looked admiringly at his
      white, even teeth. The conviction that there was nothing about him that
      would be otherwise than physically attractive to the most fastidious
      feminine sense brought him an assured content.
    </p>
    <p>
      He gazed through the blue cigar-smoke up the long vista of clashing
      traffic broadening out by Hyde Park Corner, where London at its gayest
      displayed itself in the mellow afternoon sunlight. He waved his hand
      towards it as if summoning its blithe spirit to hear him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think I'm going to give you up?&rdquo; he said, breaking into a laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      For London, to the man of the pavement, the theatres, the studios, the
      newspaper offices, the clubs, the restaurants, means the elemental medium
      of his being. The deep bosom of Mother Nature would suffocate him. It is a
      picturesque thing to talk about, and it may be exploited by an ingenious
      contriver to his considerable advantage, but it did not satisfy the
      spiritual cravings of Roderick Usher. He had not the remotest intention of
      committing himself to lifelong exile with the Walden Art Colony, if his
      supple wit could devise other means of profiting by the enterprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I nearly lost you!&rdquo; he apostrophised London again, after a few
      moments.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a certain sense, he had been meditating flight, the summary abandonment
      of his broken fortunes too far gone for satisfactory repairing. For
      Roderick was a man who demanded more from society than his talents enabled
      him to give in return. Not that he was, in the general sense of the term,
      an adventurer. He had worked hard all his life; but he had always just not
      succeeded in his undertakings. He had written a play which an enthusiastic
      young manager had run at a loss for fifty nights. A second play evoked a
      chorus of delight among the newer school of critics, but had fizzled out
      after a week's unsatisfactory existence. His succeeding plays went the
      round of rueful and head-shaking managers. Professionally he was an
      artist. He painted pictures, but prices were low. One immense and
      ambitious canvas hung at the Royal Academy was to have brought him
      everlasting fame and fortune. It was taken over by a firm of art
      publishers whose royalties on prints after two years' waiting amounted to
      a few paltry pounds. Then for some reason or the other the Academy refused
      to hang him. Hence his bitter hatred of the Academy and all its works. He
      had written a couple of novels which were universally belauded and nowhere
      bought. He was art critic, dramatic critic, reviewer, short-story writer.
      This work and the sale of such pictures as the dealers could be prevailed
      upon to purchase, together with private orders for portraits, brought him
      a maintenance. It would have been wealth to him who was content with beer,
      comfort to him who drank modest claret, but it was penury to the man who
      claimed at least 1889 champagne as a divine right. Roderick's career had
      therefore been an interminable battle with society. He rode through it a
      free lance, plundering it blandly whenever a chance offered. He had
      scarcely ever during his life as a man been free from debt. But his
      unflagging energy, his suppleness of humour, his buoyancy, his
      versatility, by winning popular esteem had saved him many times from
      social disaster. He played billiards too well; he played whist and poker
      too well. He was too disinterested an adviser of young men in search of
      ready money. Thus, somewhat paradoxically, he was welcomed at private
      houses, but looked shyly upon in clubs. Yet no one had hinted a
      dishonourable action. Twice or three times his father had groaningly sent
      him a cheque to cover some of his more pressing debts; but in justice to
      him, it must be said that in speaking of them to Matthew Lanyon, the old
      man had exaggerated the extent of his culpability. Nor had Roderick the
      slightest suspicion that any of Matthew Lanyon's money had ever found its
      way into his own pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once again, however, he found himself more seriously involved than ever,
      and his father pleaded empty coffers. There was a billbroking transaction
      which might lead to unpleasantness. He had persuaded a foolish young man
      to back bills to the amount of two or three thousand pounds. In two or
      three months they could be renewed for a further period. But after that
      would come the deluge. Exile might save him. But where should he go? To
      the Colonies? He was too old. To Boulogne, to lead a shifty life with
      compatriot wastrels? &ldquo;Sooner Death,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      But for some time past, as it happened, the scheme of the Walden Art
      Colony had been idly occupying his disinterested attention. Suddenly his
      astute mind perceived in the scheme his own social salvation. His energy
      quickly brought it into practicable shape. His plausibility staved off his
      creditors. His future position as salaried director of the Colony would
      secure him an honourable retreat from an untenable position.
    </p>
    <p>
      But now with the heiress of an ample fortune as his affianced bride, he
      could laugh at fears and exultantly send the Colony to the devil. His luck
      had turned at last. Now he would get to the heart of life. And Ella was
      sweet, great-hearted, and beautiful. It was not only for her money that he
      wanted her. Perish the miserable thought! He could conceive a noble
      existence, all ideals. His thoughts touched the Empyrean. His facile
      nature easily persuaded itself of lofty purpose, and for the moment he was
      sincere. For Roderick was a man with wings to fly, but chained to the
      earth with fetters of brass; and often his wings fanning the air gave him
      the delusion of mounting heavenward.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cab drew up at the dull and decorous door in Weymouth Street, at
      half-past six. A decorous man-servant opened it and showed him into the
      consulting-room, formally furnished with dark leather chairs and couch,
      and a desk on which lay the stethoscope, tongue-depressor, and a few other
      ordinary instruments of the physician. Some old prints hung round the
      walls. The windows, glazed halfway, to insure privacy from the street,
      gave an air of gloom to the not over cheerful apartment. Roderick compared
      it with his own light and artistically furnished chambers, and wondered at
      the dark soul of the man who could live amid such depression.
    </p>
    <p>
      He laughed his gayest laugh, however, when Sylvester came in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm about as incongruous and unexpected here as you were the other day in
      the Park,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;But you'll understand why I've come when I tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm very glad to see you,&rdquo; said Sylvester, politely. &ldquo;Won't you sit
      down?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He seated himself in the writing-chair and motioned his guest to another.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, thanks, I'll walk about,&rdquo; said Roderick. &ldquo;If I sat there I'd feel too
      much like a patient, and you'd be wanting to look at my tongue or pommel
      my stomach. I've come, my boyhood's friend, to tell you some good news, to
      demand your felicitations. I give you a thousand guesses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you succeeded in floating your chartered Thelema Company?&rdquo; asked
      Sylvester, with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, damn the Colony! That is to say, comparatively damn the Colony. You
      behold in me the happiest man on earth, engaged to the sweetest and
      loveliest girl in the world. And the Colony's in it for something. So I
      ought to have said 'thrice bless the Colony.'&rdquo; Sylvester started in his
      chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not referring to Miss Defries?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must offer you my congratulations,&rdquo; said Sylvester, recovering
      composure. Then despising himself for a momentary pang, which he could not
      explain to himself, he added: &ldquo;I am sure she will make you an excellent
      wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An excellent wife! Hear him, ye gods! As who should say, 'You will find
      this a most serviceable umbrella!' She's the dewy dawn of all things sweet
      to live for!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My habit of mind is more prosaic than yours,&rdquo; laughed Sylvester. &ldquo;But I
      think I am none the less accurate. Is Miss Defries going also to Thelema?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is the present intention. But plans are but frail barks upon the
      capricious sea of time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said Sylvester. &ldquo;Now I understand your condemnation of the
      Colony.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no; I am sure you don't,&rdquo; put in Roderick, hastily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, never mind,&rdquo; said Sylvester. &ldquo;Have you obtained my fathers
      consent?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Lanyon's consent? What for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The marriage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Ella is overage,&mdash;her own mistress.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still, she must not marry without my father's consent, or she loses her
      money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Roderick swept his hand in a magnificent gesture. &ldquo;The money's neither
      here nor there. But of course your father will consent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's the dearest old man God ever made,&rdquo; said Sylvester, in his grave
      way; &ldquo;but he has queer crotchets now and then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But this is the end of the nineteenth century,&rdquo; laughed Roderick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't deny it. The other is a fact, all the same. The late Mr.
      Defries's will is valid. Appointing my father trustee for his daughter
      Ella, it provides for his administration of the estate until either her
      marriage with his consent or his own death, whichever is first. On either
      of these events, the whole money comes into her own keeping. If during his
      lifetime she marries without his written consent, the money all goes to
      some specified charity, I forget what it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I never heard of such a damned silly will in all my life,&rdquo; said
      Roderick, falling, into the vernacular.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It only shows one man's implicit trust in the honour of another.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how much does it all run to?&rdquo; asked Roderick, casually.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven't the remotest idea,&rdquo; replied Sylvester. &ldquo;It never entered my
      head to inquire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Roderick took a few quick turns about the room, then he laughed in his
      buoyant way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if Damon Lanyon is recalcitrant, Pythias Usher will soothe him
      down. So it will all come right. And you, camarado, shall dance at the
      wedding. I swear it. I must go and dress for dinner with some Philistines
      at Cricklewood. I shall be interested to see how God makes the creatures
      who live at Cricklewood. By the way, shall I give Ella your good wishes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Most certainly,&rdquo; said Sylvester.
    </p>
    <p>
      He accompanied his guest to the front door; then returning to the
      consulting-room, he opened the window, with an exclamation of distaste.
      Roderick carried heavy scent about him, and Sylvester, like a wholesome
      Briton, detested scent. He also in his heart detested Roderick.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before preparing for his solitary dinner he went into his laboratory to
      examine some tubes of gelatine in which the anthrax bacillus was thriving.
      But he gazed at them somewhat absently. Scorn and contempt were in his
      heart,&mdash;contempt for the woman whom once he thought fit to be his own
      wife, and who had now thrown herself away upon this plausible but vulgar
      charlatan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like to like,&rdquo; he muttered cynically.
    </p>
    <p>
      And putting down his gelatine he went upstairs, apparently satisfied with
      the examination he had entirely forgotten to make.

      CHAPTER IX&mdash;DAMON AND PYTHIAS
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>r. Usher the elder
      had settled down in Ayresford a few months after the death of Sylvester's
      mother. At first he had taken a small cottage, then a semi-detached villa.
      Finally, he had transferred his household gods to a comfortable little
      house standing in its own grounds not far from Woodlands. He was not
      beloved in Ayresford on account of his habit of telling dull stories of
      uninteresting incidents in his past career; but as he went to church
      regularly and did no particular harm to anybody, he was accepted as a
      member of the humdrum society of the somnolent little town. No one knew
      much of his antecedents. He had been something in Australia and now lived
      on his means. That he had chummed with Mr. Lanyon,&mdash;a fact which he
      proclaimed so unceasingly that people grew nervous with teasing
      anticipation whenever Australia was mentioned in his presence,&mdash;was a
      sufficient guarantee of his respectability. Then Roderick came on flying
      visits and with his brilliant ways acquired popularity. Later, when he
      produced plays, painted pictures for the Academy, and wrote novels,
      Ayresford was quite proud of him. The father gained a vicarious
      reputation. They wanted to make him people's church-warden. But here
      Matthew Lanyon intervened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not a church-goer myself,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;but I'm hanged if I'll let you
      make a mockery of the whole thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Whereupon Usher replied that it was a pity for lifelong friends to quarrel
      over such a trifle, and wrote a letter to decline the church-wardenship.
      But he put a little black mark and some hieroglyphics, with the date, in a
      little black book, half filled with similar inscriptions, which he kept
      locked up in his safe. This was some years before Sylvester had left for
      London, and the black marks had gone on increasing. Ebenezer Usher was a
      methodical man.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was very proud of his house, which was tastefully furnished and
      contained a choice collection of old china, of which he was a connoisseur.
      Ayresford naturally put him down as a man of substance, and though he
      entertained as little as decency allowed, he avoided the reputation of a
      miser. His elegant leisure was passed in collecting the china above
      mentioned, postage-stamps, and book plates, and in speculating through
      outside brokers.
    </p>
    <p>
      One morning in June he sat at his table, by the open window, through which
      came all the scents of the lawn, immersed in his morning's work of sorting
      book plates. He had them before him in cardboard boxes neatly labelled on
      the back. They were divided into their several countries, subdivided into
      noble families and commoners, further divided into &ldquo;Armorial,&rdquo;
       &ldquo;Artistic-Armorial,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Fanciful,&rdquo; and they were all arranged according
      to date. A manuscript catalogue by his side gave the reference to case and
      position. A pile of loose plates, unmounted, lay immediately in front of
      him, through which he was going one by one. If the plate happened to be
      new, he put it aside for mounting. If it was a duplicate, he fished out
      his original from its case and subjected the two to anxious scrutiny
      through a magnifying-glass, to decide which was the better impression. Of
      the subject he had profound knowledge, and he had a sincere appreciation
      of beauty of workmanship. At such times as this he was the most harmless
      of old gentlemen, dignifying the evening of his days with a learned
      pastime.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was leaning back in his chair, lovingly scrutinising the almost fragile
      tenderness of an exquisite Bewick, when a servant brought in two letters
      that had come by the second post. He bade her put them on the table, and
      there they lay for some time while he continued the inspection of his
      Bewick. At last he laid it down with a sigh and opened the first letter.
      It ran:&mdash;

      Mr. Usher groaned and threw the letter away from him. He felt a most
      ill-used man. The ingratitude of the world after a laborious lifetime
      spent in its service pained him exceedingly. The sight of Roderick's
      handwriting on the other envelope by no means brought him comfort.
      Roderick's letters were rare, but unpleasantly to the point. He unfolded
      it with distrustful resignation. But when his glance had taken in its
      contents, his expression changed. He took off his gold spectacles,
      breathed on them, and wiped them with his handkerchief, and putting them
      on again, beamed at his son's letter:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     <i>Revered Parent,&mdash;I'm going to marry Ella Defries. Can't get
     shekels without Lanyon's consent to union. A silly will
     gives him the hold. Am writing now for his blessing. Better
     let me overhaul the draft of your letter of paternal welcome
     to her, as I know your effusive little habits.

     Yours,

     Roderick.</i>
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, the flippant ways of youth,&rdquo; said he, with an indulgent smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bucket-shop shark's application for cover came to him now through the
      rosy cloud of his content. What did a few hundreds matter when his only
      son was putting himself into a position to relieve from want his aged
      father's declining years? He almost caressed Mr. Vavasour's letter as he
      folded it up carefully and placed it with Roderick's in the breast-pocket
      of his old frock-coat. He felt kindly disposed towards all mankind, and
      prepared with a benevolent air to go forth and visit his friend, Matthew
      Lanyon. He cleared his table of the book plates, scrupulously putting each
      in its proper case, and then rang the bell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My hat, Olivia. And my stick. No. The sun is warm. It is very hot. I
      shall take the green umbrella.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The elderly servant brought him these articles. He put on the Panama straw
      hat with his accustomed deliberation, while Olivia held the umbrella. Then
      he took the latter in his hand, and went out with his slow old man's
      tread.
    </p>
    <p>
      On his way through the wide straggling main street of Ayresford, he
      paused, according to long custom, to look into the window of a little
      poverty-stricken bric-à-brac shop, garnished with a few rusty old pistols,
      bits of china, and worm-eaten books. To-day was displayed a couple of
      leaves torn from an old postage-stamp album. The eye of the collector at
      once fixed itself on a Canada, green and unused. He hurried into the shop.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-morning, Mrs. Driscoll; it is a very hot day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A dejected old woman rose from a stool by the counter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Lord sends it, Mr. Usher. We must abide by His mercies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must indeed,&rdquo; replied Usher, wagging his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought I would come in and help you, Mrs. Driscoll, by making a little
      purchase.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You 're very kind, sir,&rdquo; said the old woman, mournfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What might you be asking for these two sheets of postage stamps?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ten shillings, I was told, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Usher lifted up his hands pityingly and smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Mrs. Driscoll, they are not worth half a crown. But I will be
      generous. It is one's duty to be generous to the poor and needy. I will
      give you five shillings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, sir,&rdquo; said the old woman. The bargain was concluded, and Mr.
      Usher went out a very happy man. For a green, unused 7 1/2d. Canada
      postage stamp, as all philatelists know, will fetch some eight or nine
      pounds, if judiciously put on the market, and Mr. Usher had a beautiful
      specimen already in his collection. Fortune was really smiling on him this
      morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      He reached Matthew Lanyon's office in a seraphic temper, which a quarter
      of an hour's wait did not ruffle. When Mr. Lanyon's client had departed,
      he was shown into the office, where Matthew was seated at his desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought you would come,&rdquo; said Matthew, without further greeting. &ldquo;Sit
      down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not looking at all well, my dear friend,&rdquo; said Usher. &ldquo;You should
      really take care of yourself. I always say it is wrong for a man to let
      his business affairs get the upper hand with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was true. Matthew had been ailing considerably of late, and his doctor
      had urged him to do a number of impossible things,&mdash;to go for a sea
      voyage, to reduce his practice, to take a partner. He was killing himself.
      He must stop, or human science wouldn't answer for the consequences.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Human science can wait till she's asked,&rdquo; the old man had replied with a
      certain humour. The past year had aged him considerably. His hair was
      greyer, his figure slightly bent, his face and hands thinner, his brow
      more care worn. Characteristically he had told Sylvester of none of his
      ailments, and during the weekends Sylvester had spent at Woodlands, he had
      made special efforts to appear bright and strong. When Sylvester,
      anxiously informed by his aunt, questioned him, he had laughed in his
      cheery way, but with a touch of petulance, and asked how he, a man of
      science, could attribute any importance to Agatha's silly whimsies.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was not the man to be fond of pity, even from those dearest to him; <i>a
      fortiori</i>, he found Usher's sympathy particularly obnoxious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm exceedingly well,&rdquo; he said somewhat irritably. &ldquo;Better than I have
      been for months.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps the pleasant news has cheered you,&rdquo; said Usher. &ldquo;There is nothing
      like the happiness of others to make the heart young again. I am always
      rejoiced at the happiness of others. It is my nature.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He said it with such an air of dull simplicity, uttering each vocable with
      weighty deliberation, that a smile flickered around Matthew's lips. &ldquo;I
      really think you believe it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never disguise my sentiments. Falsehood is abhorrent to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rubbish!&rdquo; said Matthew, curtly. &ldquo;I'm busy. I can only give you ten
      minutes. What have you come for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To share your happiness in the engagement of our dear children,&mdash;my
      son, your ward.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not pleased at all. Even you ought to know that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not pleased?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. A marriage like that is an impossibility.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Usher opened his eyes in reproachful astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can I let my ward marry a man like Roderick?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My son is a fine fellow,&rdquo; said Usher.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He 's an infernal scamp,&rdquo; said Matthew, &ldquo;and you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has been a little wild, I allow,&rdquo; said Usher, indulgently. &ldquo;But all
      young men sow their wild oats. Even you, Matthew, have committed
      indiscretions&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I've paid for them a million times over,&rdquo; said Matthew. &ldquo;My God! I
      have paid the uttermost farthing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He passed his hand with a quick movement across his face, as if to wipe
      out a sudden contortion of features.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We needn't discuss the matter,&rdquo; he said in business tones. &ldquo;I shall not
      give my consent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't understand why it is necessary,&rdquo; said Usher.
    </p>
    <p>
      Matthew put him briefly into possession of the facts that Sylvester had
      disclosed to Roderick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They will marry without your consent,&rdquo; said Usher. Matthew laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It takes two to make a marriage, Usher.&rdquo; Usher looked at him dully and
      sighed. &ldquo;I did not expect this ungenerosity from you, Matthew. Remember I
      am a father. I have always been a most affectionate father. My affection
      has always stood in my way. I plead for my poor son.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your poor son! Why, I've supported him in comfort all his life. He earns
      a decent living himself, and twice I have saved him from gaol. By George,
      sir, he would have got there&mdash;and richly deserved it. If you think
      I'm going to give my consent to Ella marrying that confounded
      attitudinising swindler, you take me for a greater rascal than yourself.&rdquo;
       Matthew got up and walked about the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was not a man who easily lost his temper, but the idea of this marriage
      infuriated him. Usher lifted a deprecating hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps it can be arranged,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it can't. So you can go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will withdraw our claim for five thousand pounds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where do you suppose I'm to find five thousand pounds?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can do what you like with Miss Defries's money, Matthew.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Matthew stopped in his walk, and his face grew livid. He pointed to the
      door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go out,&rdquo; he said in a trembling voice, &ldquo;or I'll have you turned out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Usher rose to his feet and shuffled towards the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then poor Sylvester shall know what were the parents in whom he trusted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let him know and be damned to you!&rdquo; said Matthew.
    </p>
    <p>
      He flung open the door into the outer office, and stood rigid and white
      with anger, as Usher passed out. Then, when he was alone, he put his hand
      to his heart, and staggering to an old couch threw himself down half
      fainting among the papers with which it was piled.
    </p>
    <p>
      A clerk, coming in a few moments later to announce a client, found him
      white and gasping. But he insisted to the frightened youth on his being
      well again, drank a glass of water, and with a sheer effort of will,
      dragged himself to his feet and concentrated his faculties.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Show Sir Trevor in,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the sudden attack rendered him weak and anxious for the rest of the
      day. He had never fainted like that before. It must have been the heat and
      the fury he had flown into with Usher. When he went home to lunch Miss
      Lanyon was alarmed at his appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps I'm a little bilious. It is the heat. It's nothing,&rdquo; he said
      obstinately.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Lanyon looked at him sadly out of her faded blue eyes. If Dorothy,
      herself, or any of the household showed signs of poorliness, he would
      worry himself to death about it, get the doctors in, ransack the town for
      delicacies, and send special messengers from the office during the day to
      make inquiries. But where he himself was concerned, he was impatient of
      interference. Miss Lanyon shook her head. Men were insoluble enigmas.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the afternoon he went round the garden with his little granddaughter,
      submitting to be decorated with whatever flowers her childish fancy
      selected. He wore carnations round the ribbon of his hat, a Maréchal Niel
      rose in the lapel of his coat, and pansies stuck down his waistcoat, and
      he stalked on, gravely holding the child's hand and chatting with her on
      terms of comradeship. As they passed by the strawberry beds in the kitchen
      garden, Dorothy pointed to some ragamuffin children pressing their faces
      against the iron gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dirty little boys,&rdquo; she announced fastidiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What would you sooner give them,&mdash;soap or strawberries?&rdquo; asked the
      old man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dorothy reflected a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Soap is nasty,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we'll give them some strawberries. Open the gate and call them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She ran to the gate and gave the invitation. The children came in shyly,
      their mouths watering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Show them how to pick,&rdquo; said Matthew.
    </p>
    <p>
      She bent down and picked and gave a berry to each of the children. The old
      man walked away. Presently Dorothy came running after him. Why had he gone
      off?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They'll eat more if I'm not there,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;But why don't you stay?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One of them ate a slug,&rdquo; replied Dorothy, in disgusted dignity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man threw himself down on a garden seat and laughed. Dorothy
      clambered on to his knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me about the kangaroos,&rdquo; she commanded. So for the next hour he
      entertained her with stories of kangaroos and monkeys and crocodiles and
      the strange beasts of far lands. Then Miss Lanyon came upon them, in
      search of Dorothy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are some horrid little boys stealing the strawberries,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! are they there still? They began an hour ago. I gave them leave.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And they have been picking some of the green peaches that were coming on
      so nicely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They'll enjoy them green better than we shall enjoy them ripe,&rdquo; said
      Matthew. &ldquo;So let them be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I sha'n't. They'll be ill,&rdquo; said Miss Lanyon, with spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man went off to distribute halfpence among the children as a sort
      of compensation for loss of stomach aches, and his sister carried off
      Dorothy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dorothy,&rdquo; she said on the way, &ldquo;your grandfather is a saint.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You said he was the worry of your life to-day,&rdquo; said Dorothy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because he's too good, dear. We're none of us good enough for him,&rdquo; said
      Miss Lanyon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Matthew returned to the seat and slowly divested himself of his flowers,
      giving himself up for the moment to the peaceful charm of the afternoon
      hour. The place was dear to him. It was more or less the creation of his
      life. It was a small house in a little garden when he had brought his wife
      to Ayresford. And he had added on to both, bit by bit, building a wing,
      buying a few adjacent acres, until it had come to be a large property
      perfectly laid out.
    </p>
    <p>
      The house stood mellow and homelike in the soft sunshine, with ivy and
      clematis clustering on walls and around windows. The lawn, smooth and well
      trimmed, stretched into the dimness of a little wilderness marked by
      shrubs. The sycamores on the other side of the house waved their tops
      above the roof. He remembered when they were planted. She planted them.
      What a number of years ago! And there in the old part of the house was
      her window. The clematis had always been there. He remembered how it used
      to brush her cheek as she leaned out to call to him. It was just such an
      afternoon as this that her delicate face, like a pink shell, flushed with
      excitement, had appeared and she had summoned him nearer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mat, Baby has cut a tooth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My God! He could hear her voice now; almost wondered whether she had not
      withdrawn within, and whether the five and thirty years had not been a
      vague dream, and he himself was not young and vigorous and defiant of
      fate. But the quick memories of the day rushed back upon him and obscured
      the dearer vision.
    </p>
    <p>
      The marriage was impossible. His heart yearned towards the girl whom he
      loved with an old man's tender affection. How could he allow her to marry
      a man whom he knew, from heredity, from actual facts that had come
      miserably within his own knowledge, to be an unprincipled adventurer? The
      misery of it was that his lips were sealed. He could not tell her of
      Roderick's real character. To do that would be to break virtually the
      promise he had kept for over thirty years.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whatever I do for my own son, I shall do for yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He could no more blacken Roderick's reputation than he could Sylvester's.
      Perhaps the marriage would redeem him. Yet to stake the life's happiness
      of a human soul that was dear to him upon the chance of another's
      redemption was too great a responsibility. Why had she engaged herself to
      this man? It was not through love. He drew from his pocket the letter he
      had received from her that morning and read it through. It was
      constrained, artificial. The tone jarred upon their intimacy. Perhaps Ella
      had changed, grown worldly and cynical, lost her love for him. Or was it
      only the letter of a girl at war with her own heart? He had seen many such
      battles in his time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At any rate, I withhold my consent,&rdquo; he said decisively.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet Usher's threat agitated him more than he dared confess. He had never
      defied him before on that point. For a moment he was racked with a spasm
      of fear lest Sylvester should know the secret of his relations with Usher.
      The fear had grown with the years into the roots of his life, had become
      an unreasoning terror. To save his son the knowledge, he had been killing
      himself by inches with work and worry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly he rose, shook himself as if impatient of the clinging doubts,
      and walked briskly across the lawn. Usher daren't do it, for his own sake.
    </p>
    <p>
      Usher turned the corner of the house and met him by the door. Matthew
      frowned and regarded him angrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told you to go and be damned to you,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You made use of improper language, Matthew. You lost your temper. I never
      lose my temper. I am a most peaceful man. And I forgive. It is a Christian
      virtue. I thought you might change your mind on reflection.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven't changed my mind,&rdquo; said Matthew.
    </p>
    <p>
      Usher took an envelope from his pocket, withdrew a letter, and handed it
      to Matthew.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you like me to send that to Sylvester?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Matthew glanced through it; his fingers trembled in spite of his will. But
      he tore the paper across and across and put the fragments into his
      jacket-pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would not be such a fool as to kill the goose with the golden eggs,&rdquo;
       he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought you would do that,&rdquo; said Usher, drawing another paper from his
      pocket; &ldquo;but I have prepared a duplicate. I have always been a man of
      foresight. It is my firm intention to post this to Sylvester unless you
      give me your written consent to the marriage. I do not want money,
      Matthew. I have earned enough to keep me in comfort for the rest of my old
      age, and your promise to help my poor boy was based on no conditions. All
      the country says you are an upright man, Matthew. When I mentioned the
      five thousand pounds to-day, I was forgetting your scrupulous honour. I
      apologise. I always apologise when I am wrong. I am a just man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All through this harangue Matthew's stern gaze had never left the puffy,
      white-bearded, common face. And he saw, not for the first time, beneath
      the old man's dull and red-rimmed eyes, a hard gleam of hate. But for the
      first time he realised that even to such a man there might be something
      dearer even than money, and the chill fear fastened round his heart. He
      made an impatient movement across the threshold of the open door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come into the library,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It is an insult to God's sweet air to
      discuss such things here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Usher followed him indoors. Some time later Miss Lanyon came down, having
      changed her dress for dinner, and leaned against the jamb of the
      creeper-covered porch and drank in the softness of the summer evening with
      the country-bred gentlewoman's vague mingling of happiness and regret. She
      had heard of the engagement. It had made her sad. Why had it not been
      Sylvester instead of Roderick? She sighed over the grave of her old maid's
      vicarious romance. A footstep behind her caused her to turn. It was Mr.
      Usher, buttoning his old frock-coat. His face showed grave benevolence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A father lives in his children,&rdquo; he said, after receiving her reluctant
      congratulations. &ldquo;I live in my son.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The dinner-bell rang.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must go,&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;I came to see my old friend on business. He is
      so good. His time is always at the disposal of his friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told Dorothy this evening that he was a saint,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Usher squeezed her hand impressively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is indeed, Miss Lanyon. He is indeed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Matthew sat in his library chair staring in front of him in agony of
      spirit. He had yielded. The trace of the writing was there on the fresh
      blotting-paper before him. The strong man writhed under the humiliation of
      defeat. The proud, sensitive gentleman was tortured in his Nessus shirt of
      dishonour. And it comforted him not that it was for his son's sake. He
      felt as if he had ransomed him at the price of Ella's deliverance to the
      Minotaur.

      CHAPTER X&mdash;SYLVESTER DOES BATTLE
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">L</span>oss of faith in
      all through the faithlessness of one is a common and a tragic phenomenon.
      It is vain for the robust-minded to prove the illogic of the conclusion,
      which is one arrived at more from the emotional than the logical faculties
      of the brain. The phenomenon occurs only in men of a certain temperament.
      They are endowed with powers of intense individual passion, but lack that
      universality of sympathy which makes for breadth of judgment. To narrow
      the proposition to a particular case, they take one woman, not after long
      and patient deliberation,&mdash;that is the supreme pity of it,&mdash;but
      haphazard, on the impulse of a great emotion, and glorify her as the queen
      of all women. She becomes inevitably the test of a sex. The poor human
      touchstone fails, and a whole sex is condemned. To the commoner sort this
      loss of faith matters little, for the nobility of a great faith was never
      in them; they cultivate an easy-going cynicism, and that is all. But the
      men whose lives are broken, who feel within them the horrible weight of a
      dead ideal, are of nobler mould, and therein lies the piteousness of the
      tragedy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sylvester walked slowly homewards from his partner's house in St. John's
      Wood, where he had been dining. For Dr. Frodsham, who had ample means and
      a large family, had taken the opportunity of moving from the house in
      Weymouth Street into the purer air of the N. W. district, on Sylvester's
      entrance into partnership, and only retained a consulting-room, where he
      attended at certain hours. The sense of his loss hung heavy upon
      Sylvester. He had left a home that glowed with a happiness for ever beyond
      his reach. He had seen love, trust, sympathy, reflected from face to face
      of husband and wife. The house was glad with the laughter of youth. The
      somewhat intellectual atmosphere was softened by an indescribable
      tenderness of human relation. Faith in themselves as men and women, in
      humanity in general, gave a largeness to their social intercourse. And he
      had sat there recognising, wondering; envying, until the door had closed
      behind him and he was left to his loneliness on the silent pavement.
    </p>
    <p>
      A boy and girl of the lower class passed slowly by, she with her head on
      his shoulder, he with his arm round her waist. They were saying nothing,
      probably were maintaining a half-hour's silence, but they were undeniably
      happy, and, for the moment, Sylvester envied them. Vulgar as may have been
      their affection, they, like the Frodshams, possessed that which he had
      lost for ever,&mdash;faith. And faith meant love and love meant life. He
      had seldom felt so keenly the abomination of his desolation, and the
      craving for a woman's touch grew to a pang like hunger. And yet his whole
      nature rejected the idea of fulfilment. He shuddered as he walked, and
      strove to turn his thoughts into another channel. But the elemental
      dominates a man's will. Unconsciously he returned to the subject. Ella had
      been much in his mind since Roderick's announcement. Her yielding to such
      a lover had strengthened his conviction of the contemptibility of a
      woman's nature. Cynically he congratulated himself on his escape. He set
      down nothing in extenuation. He only saw, on the one side, a woman of
      apparent refinement whom he had once thought worthy of being his wife, on
      the other side a blatant, sensual, mercenary cad. The refined woman had
      thrown herself into the cad's arms. What was the need of looking further?
      Any woman would have done the same. The so-called virtuous were merely the
      untempted. The kindly matron at whose table he had been dining had only
      maintained her position by a series of lucky accidents. And what living
      soul could tell whether she had been true to Frodsham? But he envied
      Frodsham his unclouded faith and the happiness that love brought to his
      hearth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus Sylvester walked homewards, his thoughts revolving in a vicious
      circle. At Baker Street Station he passed through a crowd that was
      gathering around two fringed and feathered coster-girls shrieking and
      biting and cursing in a policeman's grip. They were too much for one man,
      for your coster-girl in drink is a she-devil, and possessed of
      extraordinary activities. One escaped, and as her companion was struggling
      with the constable, she rushed at his face with a gigantic hat-pin held
      dagger-wise.
    </p>
    <p>
      In an instant Sylvester had dropped his light coat and had seized the fury
      by the arms from behind. And there he held her pinioned. She kicked, she
      butted, she poured out torrents of filth, she struggled, she tried to lie
      down, to the great excitement of the crowd, who, out of respect for the
      hat-pin, kept at a reasonable distance off, and expected to see a battle
      royal in which the slight man in evening dress would get the worst of it.
      But they were not prepared for such an exhibition of sheer strength on the
      part of the slight man. He stood like a figure of bronze, holding the foul
      and frenzied Amazon almost at arm's length, lifting her like a child when
      she tried to fall, forcing her down when she tried to leap into the air.
      The tussle, as far as Sylvester was concerned, did not last long; for two
      policemen, forcing their way through the throng, speedily relieved him of
      his charge and the lady of the hat-pin. Whereupon Sylvester, cheered by
      the crowd, coolly took his overcoat from a man who was holding it, and
      walked away down Baker Street.
    </p>
    <p>
      The incident, although not tending to raise the Eternal Feminine in his
      esteem, broke the train of his morbid imaginings. He glowed with the sense
      of victory and chuckled quietly to himself. The successful application of
      one's own brute force brings exultation to the primitive savage in a man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not in such bad training, after all,&rdquo; he said to himself pleasantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      So he sprang up the steps of the house in Weymouth Street in a much
      healthier frame of mind than that in which he had descended them some
      hours before. The sudden stirring of the blood had done him good.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Lanyon is here, sir,&rdquo; said a servant, meeting him in the hall. &ldquo;He
      said he would wait until you came home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sylvester disregarded the letters lying on the hall table, and ran
      upstairs to the drawing-room, where somewhat breathlessly he expressed his
      delight and wonder at seeing his father. But he was struck almost
      immediately with dismay at the look of illness on the old man's face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have no business to be here,&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;You ought to be in bed.
      For God's sake, father, what is wrong with you?&rdquo; He looked at him keenly.
      &ldquo;It is the heart, isn't it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that and other things,&rdquo; Matthew admitted; &ldquo;I have been a bit seedy
      lately. But I'll look after myself; don't fret. And I didn't come here to
      talk about my inside. I had to come up to town on business, so I thought
      I'd look in instead of writing. I haven't been waiting long. You see, your
      man has made me quite comfortable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He pointed to a tray by his side with whisky, soda, and glasses, and a box
      of cigars. Sylvester poured himself out a drink and bit off the end of a
      cigar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's gone wrong?&rdquo; he asked, striking a match.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This confounded marriage of Ella's.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wouldn't worry about it, father, if I were you. They are just worth one
      another. She has proved she's on his level by accepting him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all, not at all,&rdquo; said the old man. &ldquo;That shows you know nothing
      of women. It is one of the most astounding facts about an astounding sex,
      that women of absolute refinement will throw themselves away upon the most
      obvious cad, be utterly blind to his coarseness, if once he gets a hold
      upon them. It's a kind of helpless infatuation. It doesn't at all argue
      the degeneration of the woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you can withhold your consent, and in the mean time try to open her
      eyes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have already given my consent, and there are reasons why I can't open
      her eyes,&rdquo; said Matthew, rather slowly, looking at his finger tips.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sylvester swung a straight-backed chair from its place and sat down near
      his father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you are not going to interfere at all? Don't you think that
the best thing you can do? Let them work out their own salvation or damnation,
      as the case may be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I love Ella as my own daughter, Syl, and I would save her if I could.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I don't understand,&rdquo; said Sylvester. &ldquo;Forgive my being impertinent,
      Syl, but this is a serious matter. Weren't you fond of Ella yourself, some
      time ago?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The eyes of father and son met, and the eyes of each were very keen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would rather not answer the question,&rdquo; said Sylvester.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You needn't,&rdquo; replied Matthew, taking a sip of his whisky and soda.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a short silence. Sylvester smoked on, his glance fixed on his
      father's face, his mind more concerned with the traces of illness and
      suffering that he read there than with the subject under discussion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Syl,&rdquo; said the old man, at last, looking at his son, &ldquo;we are neither of
      us sentimental people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose we're not,&rdquo; assented Sylvester, with a short laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good. So what I want to say to you is serious. You have been a good son
      to me. I've tried to do my duty by you. But I've never asked you to do a
      thing for my sake during the whole course of your life. Do you think I
      should be justified in starting now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It stands to reason,&rdquo; said Sylvester.
    </p>
    <p>
      Matthew rose from his chair and put his hand on his son's shoulder. With
      all the tenderness of his heart, he was a man singularly little given to
      outward demonstrations of affection.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then do everything in your power,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;to stop this marriage. For
      my sake.&rdquo; He turned and walked away. &ldquo;I can do nothing,&rdquo; he added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; replied Sylvester, quietly; &ldquo;I'll stop it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't undertake too much. I only asked you to try.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've said I'll stop it, and I will. Even if it comes to&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To marrying her myself,&rdquo; said Sylvester, grimly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Matthew sat down again, and then passed one of the long silences, so
      common between these two, who seemed to understand each other better when
      no words were spoken. Each man kept his own life's secrets hidden in his
      heart, would have gone through torture rather than reveal them to the
      other, or indeed to any human being, and yet each was dearer to the other
      than any being on earth. Speech, then, on intimate matters was dragged
      reluctantly and painfully from their souls, which preferred to hold a
      silent and mysterious communion. Even what he had said to Sylvester this
      evening seemed to Matthew an indecency, an exposure of an integral part of
      himself that the proud man kept hidden under a usually inscrutable veil of
      reserve. It was characteristic of both that the subject received no
      further allusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must think about turning in,&rdquo; said Matthew at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll go and see if they've made things comfortable for you,&rdquo; said
      Sylvester.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, bless you, man, I'm not billeting myself on you and turning your
      house upside down. I'm putting up at the Charing Cross Hotel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'd better stay here for two or three days and let me doctor you a
      bit,&rdquo; said Sylvester.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the old man pooh-pooh'd the idea. He did not want doctoring. He had
      had some worrying intricate business lately. These confounded landed
      proprietors,&mdash;they got their affairs into the most disastrous
      muddles, and when once they had put them into a lawyer's hands thought
      themselves relieved of all responsibilities and gaily went off to borrow
      more money. God may have made man in his own image, but he certainly
      forgot to supply the majority of the images with brains. However, he had
      set things straight by now and could take it easy for a bit. When he
      wanted Sylvester to doctor him, he would say so.
    </p>
    <p>
      Against his will and better judgment, Sylvester had to let him go. He
      announced his intention of walking to Charing Cross, but Sylvester
      anticipated him by whistling up a hansom at the street door. Matthew
      protested. He had always walked home.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do something for my sake,&mdash;for a change,&rdquo; said Sylvester, with a
      touch of humour.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man laughed, entered the cab, and drove off.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sylvester went upstairs to finish his cigar. The world seemed a more
      ironical place than it had appeared some hours before. He felt certain
      aches in his fingers and sundry tinglings in his shins. He stooped and
      rubbed the latter with a meditative smile. There was another young woman
      between whom and her desires he was about to come. He speculated on the
      prospect of rubbing his shins after that encounter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder how it is to be done,&rdquo; he said, lying back in his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      His promise was given. He would have unquestioningly married his fair
      antagonist of Baker Street had his father so commanded. But all the same
      it was not without uneasiness that he contemplated his mission. And as for
      the girl he had undertaken to save, he assured himself that he took no
      interest whatever in her destiny.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      To celebrate the engagement, Lady Milmo held a great reception to which
      came crowds of distinguished and undistinguished persons, but it was
      characteristic of her gatherings that the former far outnumbered the
      latter. The air hummed with congratulations and with laudations of Art.
      Sylvester, moving sardonically through the press, felt like a visitor
      dazed by the whirl of a great unfamiliar factory. He confessed the feeling
      to an acquaintance who fluttered between the two worlds of art and
      science.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The manufactory of artificial ideals,&rdquo; laughed the latter, having also to
      maintain a reputation for epigram.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wit stayed to speak with a friend, and Sylvester tried to edge his way
      towards the further end of the room where Ella stood talking with a couple
      of men. From where he was he could see that she looked more than usually
      beautiful. Her face was flushed, her eyes held the light of enthusiasm,
      her young figure in a simple white silk dress stood out proud and defiant
      against the darkness of an open window. It recalled vividly to his mind
      her attitude when long, long ago she had passionately expressed her faith
      in the glory of the world. His lips twitched in a half-smile. All around
      him he heard snatches of conversation in which the engagement was alluded
      to. A man cast doubts on Roderick's solvency. A girl declared she would
      just as soon marry a steam-organ. A lean, anxious woman with a mechanical
      grin ecstaticised over the union. The Art Colony was discussed on all
      sides.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently Roderick, resplendent in a great white bow that fell half over
      his shirt-front and almost hid a topaz solitaire, caught sight of him and
      hailed him with a southern wave of his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear comrade,&rdquo; he cried as soon as he was within hand-shaking range of
      Sylvester, &ldquo;it does my heart good to see you here to share our joy. Have
      you spoken to her yet? There she is&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      'Oh, she is fairer than the evening air
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Clad in the beauty of a thousand stars!'
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Isn't she? A throbbing moment, <i>amigo</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm glad to see you so much in love,&rdquo; said Sylvester. &ldquo;It's refreshing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cynic!&rdquo; said Roderick. &ldquo;That's why your hair is turning grey. Look at
      mine,&mdash;fresh as a rose in June. And I'm older than you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How's the Utopia?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Colossal. Come, I'll introduce you to Sir Decimus Bland. Lady Derring has
      fixed me with her glassy eye, and I must obey her call. Sir Decimus, let
      me present my oldest and most valued friend, Dr. Sylvester Lanyon, the
      terror of bacilli.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sir Decimus was a portly red-faced man who, from a habit of holding his
      hands in front of him, looked as if he were supporting a model of one of
      his Art galleries after the self-conscious manner of a &ldquo;donor,&rdquo; supporting
      his church in the company of various saints in an old Italian painting. He
      puffed as he spoke and glared amiably through a single eye-glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Delighted to make your acquaintance, Dr. Lanyon,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Your name is
      a household word in the domain of science. In our domain we also have
      bacilli to fight against,&mdash;commercialism, insincerity, all the
      cankers that destroy the soul of art.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you are going to choose an environment unsuitable for their
      development, I hear,&rdquo; said Sylvester.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, the Walden Art Colony. I am, as you may know, guaranteeing the
      Director's salary. Our fortunate friend is just the man for the post.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When do you think it will take practical shape?&rdquo; asked Sylvester.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We hope to start next spring&mdash;and under very happy auspices. I look
      upon this as a fitting culmination to the poor services I have been able
      to render to Art in this country. Are you interested in the movement, Dr.
      Lanyon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not financially. I hardly know enough about it. One thing I don't quite
      understand. I thought an artist gave out the experience he had gathered in
      his contact with real life. How is he going to get that contact if he
      buries himself in what amounts to a desert island?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He goes direct to nature,&rdquo; replied Sir Decimus, platitudinously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does he?&rdquo; argued Sylvester. &ldquo;Rocks and trees are all very well for pretty
      pictures. But what about love and sorrow and other human emotions. He
      seems to get away entirely from the important side of nature.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, so I grant. But it's hardly that,&rdquo; puffed Sir Decimus, mopping
      his forehead. &ldquo;Ah, here is Urquhart; he will tell you all about it. Don't
      you know Urquhart?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He performed the introduction, stated the case at great length with a
      confusion that irritated the scientist's trained mind, and then, with
      visible relief, moved away. Bevis Urquhart, a slight young man, with a
      tiny silky black moustache and a languid manner, began a patient
      explanation. Sylvester had heard of him as a lad of great wealth who had
      convulsed a whole county by refusing to ride to hounds and uttering
      blasphemy against partridge shooting. It was whispered that he had
      invented a new religion and had an oratory in his bedroom fitted with
      expensive idols made of chrysoprasus.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the mistake of the crowd,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;to regard Art as an
      interpretation of experience. Art has nothing to do with Life. Life claims
      all for itself and so kills Art, drains it of its blood. In other words,
      Life claims Art, Art does not claim Life. If not, Art would be
      unexpressed. The poem would remain a pure crystal in the soul of the poet,
      the picture a fair-hued mist in the fantasy of the painter. Art is the
      revelation of the Undetermined, and this can only reach its fulness in the
      quietude of the soul.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said Sylvester; &ldquo;you have given me a lucid solution of my
      difficulty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young man smiled deprecatingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me. I try to be an artist in words, and lucidity is so brutal and
      commonplace. Do you read Mallarmé?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Sylvester. &ldquo;When I want wholesome unintelligibility I read
      Rabelais.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Urquhart looked pained. There was a slight pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fond of bicycling?&rdquo; asked Sylvester, cheerily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again came the pitying smile over the face of the young semi-millionaire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know so little of the things one does with one's body,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better learn,&rdquo; said Sylvester. &ldquo;Capital exercise. Shakes up your liver,
      you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here he was carried off by Lady Milmo, who was dying to introduce him to
      somebody.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you understand all the things they talk about here?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Milmo regarded him with a twinkling eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God bless your soul, no,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose they're all exceedingly clever?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Milmo stood upon the points of her toes and looked around, as if to
      take in all her guests in one comprehensive glance. Then she half
      whispered into his ear,&mdash;&ldquo;They've all got to talk like that to one
      another for the sake of their reputations. But I go round and talk to each
      in turn of their cooks or their stomachs, according to sex,&mdash;and they
      love it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I'd sooner talk to you, Lady Milmo,&mdash;though not of my stomach,&mdash;than
      to any of these people,&rdquo; said Sylvester, with a laugh. &ldquo;Can't you steal
      five minutes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Milmo spied a couple of vacant chairs in a near corner, and sitting
      down on one motioned Sylvester to the other. Then she smiled. She was a
      kind-hearted woman, and in spite of her false air of youth possessed much
      charm of manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you want to talk about the engagement!&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not particularly. What do you think of this Colony, where Ella
      proposes to exile herself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Utter rubbish,&rdquo; said Lady Milmo.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sylvester expressed surprise. &ldquo;I was under the impression that you were
      one of its fervent propagandists.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, one must do something,&rdquo; she replied inconsequently. &ldquo;One bubble is
      just as good as another to blow during the season. Whether it's providing
      eau de cologne for released criminals, or founding a Garden of Eden for
      unsuccessful poets, it all comes to the same thing in the end. You look
      puzzled. Well, what is one person's amusement is another's bewilderment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But all these promoters&mdash;Ella and Roderick&mdash;they believe in
      it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, they believe in it. People will believe in anything,&mdash;Mr.
      Urquhart's new religion, for instance. But the Art Colony is rubbish.
      Don't put a penny in it. I haven't. It may be a romantic toy for Ella to
      play with for the first two years of her married life, but then she will
      come back and settle down to a reasonable existence. You won't give me
      away, will you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sylvester promised, and a few moments later found himself standing alone,
      wrapped in gloomy wonder at the inanity of life. A voice roused him from
      his meditation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-evening, Sylvester.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He started and found Ella by his side. She looked at him boldly, with a
      little triumphant gleam of defiance. He shook hands, explained that his
      object in accepting the invitation was to offer her his congratulations.
      Social convention required the formula. Ella's ear, however, detected an
      ironical note, and the blood came swiftly to her cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For a man who scorns hypocrisy&mdash;&rdquo; she began; then checked herself.
      His regard of grave inquiry made her swiftly conscious of a false
      position, and her cheeks flamed hotter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know what I mean,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You don't really congratulate me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you say so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I feel that you are inimical to me, and you have never liked Roderick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One can wish one's enemies well,&rdquo; he remarked with a half-smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should we be your enemies? You should hear how differently Roderick
      speaks of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Ella,&rdquo; replied Sylvester, &ldquo;I have not uttered a single word
      against Roderick. It would be in very bad taste for me to do so. I have
      known him for many years, and we still meet. But he is not an intimate
      friend of mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You dislike him,&rdquo; said Ella. &ldquo;I feel that you do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The feline that is in the nature of all women&mdash;just as its stronger,
      tigerish development is in the nature of all men&mdash;tingled to her
      finger ends. She felt the velvet sheaths stiffen back. The sight of him
      angered her. She itched to provoke him to battle, to fall on him tooth and
      claw if he took up her challenge. An unreasoning instinct clamoured also
      for violent defence of Roderick. It was a psychological moment full of
      many feminine complexities which she half understood; and that made her
      the more angry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sylvester, looking only on the surface, smiled somewhat contemptuously at
      her desire to scratch. Certainly he had undertaken a campaign against her;
      but he felt that so undignified a skirmish was not the wisest preliminary
      to hostilities. He had come here, besides, to reconnoitre.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should I dislike Roderick?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because you never try to understand anybody. Because Roderick has not
      locked himself up in your iron cage of convention; because he hasn't set
      himself up on a pillar of impeccability as you have done. You sit within
      your own prim parlour of moderation and think the man who goes to generous
      extremes is a lost soul. You need not have congratulated me. I should not
      have resented it. I should have understood and have given you credit for
      honesty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Sylvester was not to be drawn into strife. He replied equably that he
      would withdraw his congratulations, if they offended her. Meanwhile they
      might talk of something pleasanter. She suggested Shakespeare and the
      musical glasses, with a fine air of disdain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or the Walden Art Colony?&rdquo; said Sylvester.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have you to say against the Colony?&rdquo; she flashed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing at all. Do you believe in it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With all my heart. It is a great movement. It is an idea to live for. It
      is the first thing I have had to believe in since&mdash;since I threw off
      the girl and became a woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I sincerely hope it won't be the last,&rdquo; he replied with grave irony.
      And as a young man drew nigh to take his leave of Ella, he bowed and
      turned away with a saturnine sense of a victory after which there would be
      no rubbing of shins. But Ella, although she smiled sweetly on the young
      man, felt that she had been foolish in wantonly exposing herself to
      Sylvester's cold mockery, and the brightness of her evening suffered a
      miserable eclipse. It was only when Sir Decimus Bland came up and talked
      Colony with ponderous patronage, and elevated her to the dignity of
      high-priestess of the undefined cult of the Higher Art, that she regained
      her self-respect and looked more serenely on the universe.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XI&mdash;UNREST
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>t was late
      October. People were beginning to return to London, and among the early
      arrivals was Lady Milmo, who had been longing to escape from the
      discomforts of foreign hotels and English country-houses to her own
      familiar surroundings in Pont Street. With her came Ella, who was anxious
      to resume the work of the Colony. She had spent the latter part of July
      and August in Ayresford.
    </p>
    <p>
      It had been a time of rest and quiet happiness, for she loved the old man
      in a wistful, daughterly way; yet, in spite of his tender courtesy, she
      had divined in him the same antagonism to Roderick as she had discovered
      in Sylvester, and this had put a constraint in their relations which had
      never before existed. The engagement was seldom referred to, and though
      the girl's cheek flushed with pleasure at Roderick's morning letter, yet
      during the rest of the day she was happier when he was not vivid in her
      thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first it had been arranged that Roderick should pay a long-promised
      visit to his father at the same time. But when it came to the point of
      making definite arrangements, he had found his presence, in the interests
      of the Colony, essential elsewhere. As a matter of fact, the elder Usher
      jarred upon his son's more refined susceptibilities. His personal
      acquaintance with Ella was sufficiently annoying to Roderick; but to sit
      by in silent apology, while she was being overspread with unctuous and
      paternal platitudes, was an ordeal too exasperating to face. So following
      as usual the line of least resistance, he had accepted one or two pleasant
      and profitable invitations. His non-appearance, though she credited
      herself with a feeling of disappointment, was a relief to Ella. She had
      passed lately through many conflicting emotions, and she needed solitude,
      a period of moral repose, wherein to realise both herself and
      circumstances. For a proud girl does not surrender to a man almost against
      her will, without striving in her heart to account it to herself as a
      victory. The fact of the strained relations between Matthew and Usher, of
      which Miss Agatha Lanyon informed her, also mitigated her regret. They
      were at daggers drawn, did not even salute each other in the street.
      Roderick's absence avoided a grotesque Montague and Capulet situation. It
      further saved her from much personal intercourse with Usher, for whom she
      entertained no very high opinion. Once, however, she dined with him
      ceremoniously. He talked in his reiterative way of the comfort a daughter
      would be to his old age, and represented himself as the most generous and
      indulgent of parents. He alluded to Matthew more in sorrow than in anger.
      A man with whom he had been in intimate bonds of friendship for forty
      years to throw him over at the last! It was grievous; it was ageing him
      rapidly. He was always a faithful friend. It was his disposition. The
      saint leered at her out of his red-rimmed eyes, and Ella felt a shiver of
      repulsion which lasted till the next morning, when a fervid epistle from
      Roderick restored her serenity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't make out why Matthew and Mr. Usher have quarrelled,&rdquo; said Miss
      Lanyon during the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I wonder why they haven't quarrelled for forty years,&rdquo; returned Ella.
      &ldquo;Oh, don't look shocked, auntie. It is no reason for me to adore a man
      because I am engaged to his son!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thenceforward she became a violent though silent partisan of Matthew in
      his dispute. There must have been serious grounds for such a quarrel;
      Matthew could do no wrong; therefore Usher must have treated him
      shamefully. The syllogism was perfectly conclusive. This feeling and a
      growing anxiety as to the old man's health did much to lessen the
      constraint between them. For he was constantly ailing, and was not the man
      she had seen fifteen months before. She left him with great reluctance, in
      spite of the glowing impatience of Roderick, with whom she was to spend
      some weeks as the guest of Sir Decimus Bland.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now it was October, and London life began again. Lady Milmo busied herself
      in spinning her gossamer web of affairs and appeared smiling and
      contented. Ella devoted herself to such studies as she considered would be
      of benefit in her peculiar position as Lady Director of the Colony.
      Roderick was ever by with suggestion and advice. Things were going
      splendidly. Some three thousand pounds had already been subscribed and lay
      at Roderick's bankers. Three thousand more had been promised, irrespective
      of Sir Decimus's undertaking to provide the Director's salary. With
      another four thousand they could start. Ella offered to provide it.
      Roderick shook his head. It had better come from the great heart of the
      public. She persisted and wrote to Matthew. He urged her almost
      passionately not to put money into the scheme until she was married. Thus
      Roderick and Matthew were in accord on the point, and Ella was puzzled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When is it to be, dearest?&rdquo; asked Roderick one day.
    </p>
    <p>
      The question came suddenly after a short pause in their talk. It was
      during the few minutes before dinner. Roderick was dining in Pont Street,
      and Lady Milmo not having come down yet, they were alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know,&rdquo; replied Ella, with a half-smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, do I?&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I don't love contingencies. I long for the glorious
      life with you, my wonderful Ella. And I am a man, and waiting is hard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She flushed slightly. The consciousness of being desired ever quickens a
      woman's pulses. But she also loves the sense of mastery in maintaining
      herself within impregnable walls. In this perhaps lies the delicious
      paradox of her sex.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I keep to my terms,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Within a week of our starting for the
      Colony. Not before. It will give a new sacredness to our work and to our
      married life if we begin them both at the same time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But who knows when the inauguration of the colony will be?&rdquo; asked
      Roderick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It could be now, practically, if you would let me furnish the deficit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, no,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You would be acting against a principle very dear to
      me. It must be others who give their money. We give our lives. If you
      subscribe, the prestige of the Colony as a great public movement is gone.
      It is bound to come to ripeness. But like an exquisite fruit it takes
      time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am happy to wait for the ripening,&rdquo; said Ella.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I?&rdquo; He threw out his arms passionately. &ldquo;Ella, do you know what the
      madness of love is? Don't you fear that in the first rapturous days of
      life with you I might forget the work for your enchantment? Would it not
      be better to begin the work in the sweet fulness of our wedded life,&mdash;when
      we have learned each other in the way that only wedded life can teach?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will be better to begin things together,&rdquo; she replied with feminine
      reiteration.
    </p>
    <p>
      He pleaded flamboyantly. Why not fix the date of his great happiness for
      Christmas,&mdash;the time of universal rejoicing? The marriage would
      stimulate imaginations. The deficit would be made up fourfold.
      Subscriptions would come in by way of wedding gifts. Ella remained calmly
      obdurate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Before I loved you, the cause was everything to me. Since then, you are
      everything. The cause is second. It is the irrefragable law of life and
      love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To me,&rdquo; replied Ella, &ldquo;the cause and you are one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She glanced up swiftly and caught, as it seemed, a look of irritation on
      his face,&mdash;a contraction of the brows, a snarl of the lips between
      the auburn moustache and beard, showing the teeth. But it passed like a
      lightning flash and left his face aglow with such exuberant adoration that
      she attributed it to some-trick of shadow, and dismissed it from her mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      But as the days went on, a vague uneasiness took root and began to grow.
      Roderick spoke less of the Colony, more of herself. Negotiations appeared
      to be at a standstill. No more names swelled the subscription list;
      Roderick took no further steps to make fresh converts among the young and
      ardent. He pleaded the necessity of work to supply ordinary personal
      needs. He tried to awaken her enthusiasm over a flaring picture of <i>Love
      the Destroyer</i>, which he had begun to paint. She went one day to his
      studio to see it. Love stood, triumphant and cruel, a two-handed sword in
      his hand. Around him was the carnage for which he was responsible. An
      emaciated creature at last gasp was kissing his feet. There was a
      suggestion of the flesh in it that jarred upon the girl. The commonplace
      of the conception chilled her. She remained staring at the picture. It was
      long before she could trust herself to look at Roderick. At last she did
      so, unable to hide her disappointment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do not like it?&rdquo; said Roderick, eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive me&mdash;&rdquo; she began rather piteously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say no more,&rdquo; he cried, and with a magnificent gesture he seized a cloth,
      and in great, swift sweeps of his arm smeared the picture into a horrid
      chaos of greens and yellows. Ella sprang forward with a little cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So perish all in me that you deem unworthy!&rdquo; he exclaimed fervently.
    </p>
    <p>
      The act brought the woman in her to his feet. Who was she to judge the
      creation of an artist's genius? Had he let it stand, she would have loved
      the picture. The annihilation, at her bidding, of the result of days of
      artistic travail smote her with a sense of guilt. She was ready to lament
      a lost masterpiece. She would never rest until he repainted it. He
      magnanimously refused. The first impression of a picture on a pure and
      beautiful soul was the true one. She would be the touchstone of all his
      life's work. He sent her away at once raised and humbled. But to make
      amends, she threw herself earnestly into a new conception of the subject
      that he put before her, and watched it taking shape upon the canvas with
      intense eagerness. And in the meanwhile the Colony was not quite so much
      on the surface of her thoughts. Now and then, however, she questioned him
      anxiously. Once he turned upon her in solemn reproach,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do I understand that you are afraid of my faltering in the sacred cause
      to which we have devoted ourselves?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ella was impressed with his dignity and again rebuked herself for her want
      of faith. Women are indignant when they are told how often they are taken
      in by fustian.
    </p>
    <p>
      November came. She met Sylvester at dinner one evening at Lady Milmo's for
      the first time since the At Home in July, given to celebrate her
      engagement. He sat silent during the meal. Roderick, who made the fourth,
      was in his gayest mood. Rebellious defiance again came uppermost in the
      girl's heart, and she strove to put forward all her brilliance. She
      compared the two men: one, cold, sombre, severe,&mdash;a mere intellect
      clothed in the outer semblance of humanity; the other warm-hearted,
      enthusiastic, sensitive to every impression of life, and gifted with a
      perception of a world that had never entered into the purview of his
      fellow's dreams. She fortified her unmitigated resentment against
      Sylvester with disdain. How could she ever have loved such a bloodless
      piece of mechanism? She lashed with scorn her girlish folly. A heightened
      colour and an added lustre to her eyes rendered dazzling her ordinary
      girlish beauty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not one, but all wondrous womankind's epitome to-night,&rdquo;
       whispered Roderick, in the drawing-room afterwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is foolishness,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;but I&mdash;I was just going to say I
      have never felt so proud of you as I have done this evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Roderick laughed. &ldquo;I'm afraid it is because dear old Syl sits by so glum
      while I'm such a chatterbox,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ella shot a swift glance upwards. Really this man had marvellous
      intuition. Could he ever have suspected&mdash;? Her cheek burned. But to
      her comforting no trace of malicious insinuation lurked in the frankness
      of his eyes. His deprecation of her tribute was sincere.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Milmo went to the piano. She had a dainty taste in music, and having
      lately added an obscure but colossal Herzigovinan rhapsodist to her
      menagerie, found intense delight in his compositions. He was only two and
      twenty and had already reached op. 236. This Lady Milmo began to play,
      while Roderick self-sacrificingly turned over the leaves. Sylvester
      exchanged commonplace remarks with Ella. The consciousness of the task he
      had undertaken somewhat weighed upon him. He was to break off the
      marriage. How? Only by fair means. A man of scrupulous honour, he
      characterised as foul any secret investigations into Roderick's financial
      position or past career. Nor could he asperse Roderick's character while
      maintaining with him a semblance of friendly relations. To declare open
      war would be foolish. He could do nothing but bide his opportunity.
      Meanwhile he was less than ever at his ease with Ella. She, however,
      interpreted his constraint as contemptuous indifference, and once more she
      longed for battle. The memory of her humiliation on the night of Lady
      Milmo's reception only made her irritation more unbearable. A chance
      remark about his father gave her the longed for opportunity to stab.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you know Uncle Matthew's health is failing,'' she said
      suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid so,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why aren't you by his side to take care of him? Since you left he
      has been gradually breaking down. Neglect is killing him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sylvester curled the ends of his moustache and regarded her impassively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are trying to hurt me,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I do not neglect my father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. You are a paragon of all the excellences. If you had some
      infirmities, you might be a better and a happier man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not believe in the new doctrine of the saving quality of evil,&rdquo; he
      replied. &ldquo;I am of the old-fashioned opinion that evil taints the
      character, blunts the moral sense, and comes out sooner or later in evil
      actions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You talk like a Sunday-school tract,&rdquo; said Ella, with a short laugh. &ldquo;But
      I was speaking of Uncle Matthew&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like to speak of him too,&rdquo; said Sylvester, curtly. &ldquo;Your
      engagement is a great unhappiness to him. He loves you like his own
      daughter. You know that. If you had consulted him beforehand, perhaps it
      would have been kinder. What his reasons are for wishing it broken off I
      do not know, but you may be quite certain they are good ones.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ella looked across the room to the piano where the Herzigovinan rhapsody
      was in full tumult of crashing chords, and then edged nearer Sylvester on
      the couch where they were sitting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you aware that you are committing an impertinence in speaking to me
      like that?&rdquo; she said in an undertone. &ldquo;How dare you? I acknowledge Uncle
      Matthew as my guardian. But you&mdash;what right have you to touch upon my
      affairs? What concern can you have in them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Absolutely none,&mdash;personally. But my father is dear to me. If I
      could break off your engagement to please him, I should do so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you going to try?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I shall try,&rdquo; he replied coldly. Their eyes met in undisguised
      enmity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would take a better man than you, Sylvester Lanyon,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      She rose and walked to the fireplace, with an air of great stateliness.
      Sylvester did not attempt to follow her, but lay back on the couch as if
      rapt in the music. But his evil mood was upon him. He had at once divined
      her desire to wound him in his tenderest spot. It was like a woman. He
      felt a great scorn for her. The music suddenly ceased. He uttered a
      conventional murmur. Roderick broke into ecstatic comment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A divine genius! Interpreting the message of the wild winds of his
      mountain fastnesses,&mdash;the elemental throbbing in the hearts of his
      rugged forefathers. Ella, Moskovic must come to Walden. This supreme
      spirit must not be clogged by the banality of London concert rooms. He
      must breathe the freedom of the woods and streams.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has half consented already,&rdquo; said Ella.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The silly fool!&rdquo; muttered Sylvester, beneath his breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, my comrade,&rdquo; cried Roderick, turning suddenly round, &ldquo;what message
      has science to deliver comparable to this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None that I'm aware of, thank Heaven!&rdquo; replied Sylvester.
    </p>
    <p>
      Roderick broke into his gay laughter and crossed the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must think of him kindly, as good Catholics do of those that sit in
      darkness and ignorance, eh, Ella?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With a lover's gesture he passed his arm lightly around Ella's waist, and
      drew her with ever so delicate a pressure a little nearer to him, and
      looked tenderly into her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sylvester started to his feet. A feeling unexpected, undreamed of,
      hateful, passed through him,&mdash;a wave of disgust, of sudden, fierce
      hatred of Roderick standing there as the undisputed possessor of Ella
      Defries. Had the man kissed her, he would have struck him. A phrase
      formulated in Heaven knows what cell of his brain leaped with ghastly
      suddenness into his mind. How dare that loathsome brute touch her? The
      revulsion was physical, almost unendurable. It lasted but a moment or two.
      Then Ella moved away and Lady Milmo came up with a light remark, and the
      world was as it was before,&mdash;a great grim vanity which he regarded
      with apathetic indifference.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took his leave early, pleading professional duties. Ella gave him a
      defiant hand and her lips had a contemptuous curl as she bade him
      good-night. Roderick, taking upon himself the part of man of the house,
      accompanied him downstairs and pressed whisky and soda upon him amid
      fervid expressions of regard. The discreet man-servant helped him on with
      his overcoat, and the welcome cold air of the street was upon him. There
      was a touch, of early frost and the stars shone clear. The memory of his
      unaccountable seizure half an hour ago brought back the memory of a night
      in Ayresford when he had read, as his heart prompted, the message of the
      stars. He hailed a passing cab, entered it with the air of a man who has
      the business of life to consider and not the dreams of a dead past. But in
      spite of himself the dreams came back, ugly and chilling, and he spent the
      drive home in brooding thought. What did Roderick's caresses matter to
      him? Did he not despise Ella utterly? For aught he cared they might marry
      into eternal misery to-morrow. It was only for his father's sake that he
      wished to part them. Roderick was a plausible knave, Ella a woman, feline,
      treacherous, delicate of face and gross of soul. They were well paired. He
      laughed cynically as he settled down to his evening's work in his
      laboratory. Here at least were things which he could understand. The
      growth of a bacillus in a bed of jelly was comprehensible. He could see
      it, test it. But who could see the growth of a lie in the heart of a human
      being? And the man himself was unconscious that a dead love had awakened
      that evening from its sleep and had passionately, for one brief instant,
      raised the stone that covered the mouth of its tomb.

      CHAPTER XII&mdash;THE CAUSE WANES
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">R</span>oderick drove away
      from Lady Milmo's in a far more comfortable frame of mind than Sylvester.
      The evening had been a success. Hitherto, in spite of his conviction that
      his hold upon Ella was secure, he had been puzzled as to the nature of her
      feelings towards him. Over the life-work they were to carry out in common
      she had always glowed; in their purely personal relations she had
      exhibited a sad lack of emotionality. His vanity had often been piqued by
      her regarding him less as a man than as the incarnation of an idea. At the
      same time his own feelings had been simulated to love. He honestly desired
      her beauty, youth, and wit. As a proof thereof, he had abandoned with
      entire distaste the latest of the many minor affairs of the heart in which
      his emotional life had been spent. A breath of something sweeter, purer,
      nobler, had stirred his soul. The train of courtesans shrank back
      affrighted, and he walked serene with the higher woman. But desiring her
      thus uniquely, the man in him craved response. Until to-night she had
      given none. To-night, however, the statue had grown warm woman. She had
      avowed her pride in him, had yielded adorably to his caress; before they
      parted she had given him her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last he felt the triumph of possession. At last she was his to mould
      and cherish. A little pleading and their wedded life would dawn with the
      New Year. He was confident of victory.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet his heart sank like lead two days afterwards, when he had dropped a
      couple of letters into the pillar-box outside his chambers. He stopped and
      gazed abstractedly at the oblong imperturbable mouth of the red, almost
      personal thing, to which he had irrevocably intrusted his destiny. For the
      letters contained cheques to the amount of over three thousand pounds, and
      the balance at his bankers, on whom they were drawn, consisted mainly of
      the funds of the Walden Art Colony.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet what could he have done? To-morrow the bills, once renewed, with a
      foolish youngster's name at the back of them, would fall due. His father,
      to whom he had trusted, had refused help. The forcing of the youngster to
      pay would at the least create scandal, and scandal would mean loss of
      reputation, loss of Ella, and general downfall. Misappropriation of the
      funds saved his credit for a season. It would give him time to urge on his
      marriage, whilst he cunningly arrested the progress of the Colony. Once
      married, he was practically master of Ella's fortune. A pretext for
      obtaining a few thousands, so as to replace the misappropriated sum with
      his bankers, would easily be found by a man of his resource. Before
      posting the letters he had felt the half-contemptuous exhilaration of the
      gambler who bets on a certainty. But now that the bet was entered and made
      final, doubts and fears began to assail him. He looked two years older as
      he walked down St. James's Street to his club.
    </p>
    <p>
      A whisky and apollinaris restored his nerves, so that when young Lathrop,
      who had backed the bills, came up to him with a long face, he was able to
      assume his southern manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dearest of friends&mdash;&rdquo; he began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It strikes me, Usher, <i>you</i>'ll be the dearest of friends to-morrow,&rdquo;
       broke in the young man,&mdash;&ldquo;those confounded bills, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bills!&rdquo; cried Roderick. &ldquo;What are you talking to me of bills for? Do you
      think I am going to let the bloodsuckers feast upon your young and
      beauteous form? My child, put aside that pessimism which is sapping your
      youth. Behold, Israel is satisfied.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He drew his cheque-book from his pocket and showed the counterfoils to the
      two cheques. Lathrop looked intensely relieved. Then he blushed and
      stammered. He was devilish sorry; but the time was getting so close. Would
      Usher have a drink? Roderick assented and drank another whisky and
      apollinaris.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You needn't noise abroad the fact of my astounding solvency,&rdquo; he said,
      before they parted. &ldquo;I hope you haven't told any one about the bills.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only Urquhart. I saw him last night,&rdquo; said the young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll be a Metternich yet, Willie,&rdquo; replied Roderick. As young Lathrop
      belonged to the diplomatic service, he was dimly conscious that his
      friend's remark was in some fashion ironical. But Roderick waved him a
      flourishing adieu and swaggered out of the club.
    </p>
    <p>
      A man met him on the steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seen Willie Lathrop lately?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Roderick looked him squarely between the eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He 's a braying jackass,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having thus conveyed an answer to the implied question and given vent to
      his anger at the same time, he hailed a cab and drove to Pont Street. It
      was a foggy, murky day. Already the lights had appeared in shop windows,
      and, where they streamed, the pavement and roadway glistened in brown
      slime. Impressionable to external surroundings, Roderick shivered and drew
      his fur coat closer round him. The world wore an air of hopeless
      depression. On such a day no human undertaking could prosper. It was only
      his intellectual contempt for superstition that restrained him from
      turning round and driving back to his club. The dreary stretch of Sloane
      Street seemed interminable. At last he arrived and was shown up to the
      drawing-room. Lady Milmo, Ella, and a lady visitor were having afternoon
      tea. He exerted himself to amuse in his usual way, but his efforts
      resulted in failure. When should he be able to see Ella alone? The lady
      visitor seemed resolved to outstay him. She plied him with questions
      concerning the Colony. He replied vaguely. Realisation of the project was
      a long way off. To start such a concern otherwise than on a sound
      financial basis was magnificent, but it was not business. He was thinking
      of a last appeal to the public. Ella listened, somewhat out of spirits.
      Roderick's pessimistic utterances argued loss of faith in the Colony. He
      caught her glance fixed upon him with perturbed questioning, and his
      depression deepened.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last they were alone. He cleared his throat and plunged into the midst
      of things. Speech restored his confidence. He made an eloquent appeal. He
      loved her, worshipped her; the deferring of their marriage to an
      indefinite date was making his heart sick, robbing him of energy and the
      joy of life. Christmas it must be. He hinted at personages waiting for
      their marriage to subscribe largely to the fund. What had the marriage to
      do with it? Well, he was an artist, a Bohemian; his very class did not
      inspire confidence. But his marriage would set upon him the seal of
      irreproachable responsibility. He pleaded desperately, the restoration of
      the three thousand pounds being his paramount and imperative aim. His
      heart sank at the coldness with which she received his fervour. His ear
      detected the note of insincerity, to which he felt conscious she, too, was
      sensitive.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't marry you yet, Roderick,&rdquo; she said, at length, wearily. &ldquo;I can't.
      It means too much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you don't love me,&rdquo; he exclaimed, starting to his feet. The old
      dramatic device did not succeed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sometimes I do,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;At others&mdash;I don't know&mdash;I shall
      love you wholly when we realise our dreams.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That will be the Great Never Never,&rdquo; he replied tragically, &ldquo;for when did
      man ever realise his dreams?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The dressing gong sounded through the house. She rose and put out her
      hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must be patient with me, Roderick. Usually you understand so finely;
      can't you understand now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand that you are a woman of an imperious will, to which it will
      always be my pride to bow,&rdquo; he responded.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no help for it. No more pleading could move her that afternoon.
      He had to take his leave. When the drawing-room door shut behind him, his
      expression changed, and he descended the stairs cursing the Colony and all
      who were concerned therein. He went back to his club, dined, lost fifty
      pounds at cards, and went to bed morose and miserable.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning he was greatly surprised by a visit from Sylvester. He
      was sitting in the well-lit corner room of his chambers, which he had
      converted into a studio, in front of the new picture he was painting from
      Ella's conception. His heart was not in it. No good could ever come from
      such tame propriety. And there he sat in an armchair, his legs extended
      compass-wise, glowering at the picture, when Sylvester came in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What fog has driven you here, camarado?&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;You have arrived in
      season. This beastly world is standing on its head, and I don't know what
      to make of it. Sit down and have some absinthe, the only true comfort the
      devil has vouchsafed us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He pointed to a glass of the opalescent liquid by his side. Sylvester
      declined the consolation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to have a little talk with you about your marriage,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, damn my marriage!&rdquo; exclaimed Roderick, irritably. &ldquo;I tell you the
      idiot world is gyrating indecently on its occiput; my engagement with the
      rest of things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it broken off?&rdquo; inquired Sylvester, hopefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The same thing. Postponed to the Millennium.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Colonial Millennium&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. You are quite right, <i>fratello mio</i>, to keep clear of women and
      their works. No man can ever fathom their infinite incomprehensibility.
      Look here&mdash;&rdquo; He rose and marched about the studio, burning with a
      sense of his wrongs and led by the instinct of his temperament to give
      vent to his grievances. &ldquo;I love that girl with an imbecile passion. Art is
      great, but love is greater. I would make a holocaust of all that is dear
      to me in the world in the sacred name of Art. Am I not ready to expatriate
      myself? Have I not been working like Sisyphus for months? But I can't
      throw my elemental sex into the blaze. Six months' waiting is enough for
      all but anchorites. Do I look like an anchorite? I urge her to fix the
      marriage at Christmas. She's as hard as your Philistine's head. We must
      wait until the Colony is a <i>fait accompli</i>. How is it going to be
      accomplished without money?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought the scheme was getting along famously,&rdquo; interposed Sylvester.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So did I, but it isn't. It hasn't appealed to the imagination of this
      haggis-brained public, and so funds remain stationary. As if this worry
      and disappointment isn't enough for a man! <i>Point d'argent, point de
      Suisse</i>. No money, no colony. No colony, no marriage. The two things
      could never be connected save in the ineffable convolutions of the
      feminine brain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said Sylvester. &ldquo;It is hard lines on you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was intensely relieved by Roderick's confidences; could afford even to
      be magnanimous. Since his avowal to Ella of hostile intentions, he had
      felt it his duty to inform Roderick of his attitude. He had come this
      morning prepared to make a declaration of war. There were several little
      things he had learned incidentally of Roderick's past career, with which
      he had intended to confront him. The memory of Mr. Snodgrass informing the
      small boy that he was going to begin came into his mind as he mounted the
      stairs, and he smiled grimly. But, after all, no one had ever questioned
      the chivalry of Mr. Snodgrass's motives. His first words on entering were
      an announcement of the object of his visit. Roderick had implicitly
      declared that object to be futile. To proceed further would be to attack a
      fallen man. To express satisfaction would be to triumph over a foe's
      discomfiture. He therefore expressed conventional sympathy. It was hard
      lines.
    </p>
    <p>
      Roderick caught up the phrase and wove it into a fugue of indignant
      lamentation. Luck never came his way. The stars in their courses had
      fought against him since his cradle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some men's touch turns everything to gold; mine to brass and deuced
      gimcrack brass at that. I've never loved a dear gazelle; but if I had, the
      disastrous animal would have got mange or delirium tremens and turned
      round and bitten me and given me hydrophobia. I suppose it's because of my
      general nefariousness. I wish I had been an austere embodiment of the
      seven deadly virtues like you, <i>amigo</i>. Then I should have waxed fat
      and prosperous. But there,&rdquo; he added, lighting a cigar, &ldquo;that's enough. I
      don't know why I'm washing you in this torrent of my discontent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it has done you any good, I am not sorry to have heard it,&rdquo; said
      Sylvester. &ldquo;As for the Colony, I never did think much of the idea, you
      know. It is outside the sphere of practical affairs altogether. Besides,
      you could never stay more than a month away from Piccadilly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It meant a means of livelihood for this profitless child of nature,
      anyway,&rdquo; said Roderick, watching the wreaths of his cigar-smoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me if I take a liberty,&rdquo; said Sylvester, &ldquo;but I was under the
      impression that your father made you a good allowance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Roderick stared at him for a moment and then laughed loud.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't know Usher senior. How much the old man has, or where the devil
      it all came from, I have no idea; but I don't get any of it. And when he
      descends to realms below, he'll bequeath it all to a home for decayed
      postage-stamp collectors. No; I get what I earn. The Colony was a fixed
      income.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you'll have to settle down to something else,&rdquo; said Sylvester,
      consolingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And meanwhile you can go and persuade our fair enthusiast that the Colony
      is all a fizzle and that she must shed happiness upon the head of your
      devoted friend at Christmas!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't think I can do that,&rdquo; said Sylvester, drily. He pulled out his
      watch, announced his departure. Roderick shook his hand effusively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, by the way,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you haven't told me what you came for&mdash;my
      marriage&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, after what you've said about the matter that can wait,&rdquo; replied
      Sylvester, hurriedly, and he left his friend to his artistic solitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      Roderick felt somewhat ashamed and somewhat relieved after his burst of
      confidence. To cry defeat after the first reverse seemed the part of a
      craven. Thus were women not won. He determined to return to the attack, to
      choose his time more wisely. A week later he caught Ella in a brighter
      mood. He had exerted himself to please, to kindle her enthusiasms, which
      shone from cheeks and eyes. He struck the personal chord, watched eagerly,
      seemed to perceive it vibrate through her. Then he urged once more. She
      changed suddenly, held out a warning hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not that again, Roderick,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You must not make me dread your
      coming. Some women yield to insistence; it only hardens me. I thought you
      knew me better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then the Colony shall start at Christmas; I swear it,&rdquo; he cried
      magniloquently, and the remainder of the interview flowed more smoothly.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is all very well to command events. But whether they will obey is a
      different matter. During the last few weeks Roderick had succeeded in his
      design to quash the Colony in so far as to alienate several hesitating
      supporters. To win these back was no easy matter. Moreover, his old power
      of persuasion seemed to have failed him. There was a period when he had
      deluded himself into the belief that the Colony was a practicable scheme.
      But the moment it had appeared contrary to his own interest and he had
      regarded it dispassionately, he despised it from the depths of his soul as
      an inane chimera. To have to simulate a burnt out enthusiasm was irksome;
      he failed to carry conviction. And meanwhile he was a prey to gnawing
      anxiety. How was he to replace the three thousand pounds? He anathematised
      the feminine temperament.
    </p>
    <p>
      The feminine temperament, however, was not in that state of dispassionate,
      yet unreasoning decision in which he imagined it to be. These were unhappy
      days for Ella. She seemed to have become to herself a vague entity
      wandering in a land of shadows, forced by some unknown power therein to
      wander, and finding her only hope of salvation in one elusive light that
      gleamed fitfully in the distance. Her aunt, being a practical woman, was
      quick to notice the habitual contraction of her brow and the wearied
      preoccupation in her eyes. Nowadays she openly mocked at the Colony. On
      such occasions Ella fired up, defended it with the fierceness of a forlorn
      hope. Lady Milmo was puzzled. She even went the length of consulting
      Sylvester, surprising him considerably by a morning call in Weymouth
      Street.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Colony's a fraud, and she knows it's a fraud,&rdquo; she said, in the
      vernacular of her class. &ldquo;And yet she pins her immortal soul to it. Why
      doesn't she marry the man and be done with it? But no&mdash;she won't do
      that. She's making herself ill because the Colony isn't likely to come
      off, which is distinctly good business, and what on earth she can find to
      interest her in the rubbishy scheme, goodness only knows. If she only
      painted, or wrote poetry, or out-Wagnered Wagner in immortal tunelessness,
      one could perhaps understand. But she's no more artistic than you are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know I'm a Philistine,&rdquo; smiled Sylvester, at the tribute of the artless
      lady. &ldquo;Is that why you 've come to me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you know what I mean,&rdquo; returned Lady Milmo. &ldquo;Now can't you put some
      sense into her, or get that dear Mr. Lanyon to do so? It's my impression
      she isn't in love with him one little bit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, for Heaven's sake, my dear Lady Milmo,&rdquo; said Sylvester, earnestly,
      &ldquo;do all you can to impress that fact upon him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should be glad if the engagement were broken off,&rdquo; said Lady Milmo,
      reflectively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So would all the true friends of Ella Defries,&rdquo; replied Sylvester.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Milmo arched her eyebrows. She looked at him for a moment
      quizzically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that purely a disinterested remark, Dr. Lanyon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would not marry one single woman that is now living on this earth,&rdquo;
       said Sylvester.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, whatever have we poor creatures done to you? There are some men, I
      know, who look upon women as a disease, but I'm sure you 're not one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sylvester scanned his finger nails,&mdash;a trick he had caught from his
      father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One marriage is enough for a man, Lady Milmo,&rdquo; he said in a low voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Milmo was conscious of an indiscretion. She escaped adroitly and led
      the talk back to Roderick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think we'd better get this silly affair of Ella's broken off, don't
      you?&rdquo; she said at parting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you could manage it, my father and myself would be exceedingly
      grateful to you,&rdquo; he replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Milmo was driving away, her kind head filled with schemes for Ella's
      extrication, when, at the block at Oxford Circus, she caught sight of a
      news-vendor wearing as an apron the coloured bill of an early edition of
      an evening paper. Across it in enormous capitals ran the startling legend,
      &ldquo;Sudden Death of Sir Decimus Bland.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The best thing the pompous old idiot has ever done in his life!&rdquo; said
      Lady Milmo.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIII&mdash;THE USES OF ADVERSITY
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>t was the
      music-room in Mr. Bevis Urquhart's mansion in Park Street. The floor was
      polished, the walls panelled in white and gold, the ceiling painted in the
      Watteau style. About forty fashionably dressed people sat on gilded chairs
      in the body of the room. High in front of them towered the organ; beneath
      it stretched a low platform containing a white and gold grand piano pushed
      into a corner, and a Louis XV. table, at which sat half a dozen men. Among
      these was Roderick, looking worn and jaded, and from the front row of the
      chairs Ella Defries viewed him in some concern. The committee of the
      Walden Art Colony had called a general meeting of those interested in the
      project, and Mr. Bevis Urquhart had lent his music-room for the purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Redmayne, R. A., had been voted into the chair. He was a business-like
      looking little man, clean-shaven and precise in attire, and he spoke in a
      dry, sharp way like a barrister. He announced to the meeting what Roderick
      had heard some days before,&mdash;that Sir Decimus Bland had died suddenly
      and had made no testamentary provision for the Colony. They all had looked
      to him for the payment of the Director's salary and for the guaranteeing
      of any pecuniary deficit that might occur in working the concern. Their
      chief support gone, it was for the meeting to decide whether the scheme
      should be continued or abandoned. From a memorandum supplied by Roderick
      he read a statement of accounts. Three thousand and twenty pounds at Mr.
      Usher's bankers; two thousand promised. Was there any person or
      combination of persons willing to fill Sir Decimus Bland's place? He sat
      down. No one responded. Lord Eglington, a withered gentleman with a
      cracked voice, rose from the committee table, and after expounding the aim
      of the Colony regretfully proposed the entire abandonment of the scheme.
      Mr. Bevis Urquhart seconded the resolution.
    </p>
    <p>
      Roderick caught an appealing glance from Ella and sprang to his feet. He
      pleaded eloquently. He had worked with heart and soul to organise the
      Colony; was ready to devote his existence to it. The future of Art was at
      stake. Here was the one glorious chance the century had offered to free
      Art from the shackles that had degraded it and through its inexorable
      influence had degraded modern life. Never had he felt such pain as when he
      had heard Lord Eglington and Mr. Urquhart propose to dismiss the scheme to
      that unutterable horror of desolation, the limbo of forsaken ideals. He
      adjured them to weigh the vast responsibility they had taken upon
      themselves. He urged those present to respond generously to his appeal for
      funds to carry on the work.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I speak as a man,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;fighting for dear life, for all that is
      sacred and holy to me in existence. I have pledged myself to bring this
      boon upon the world, and I will do it ere I die.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He sat down, flushed and excited. The company, moved by his enthusiasm,
      applauded encouragingly. Ella rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will be a disgrace to us all if the motion is carried,&rdquo; she said,
      turning round to the general body. &ldquo;Let us fill up a subscription list
      now. I will head it with five thousand pounds.&rdquo; She sat down. There was a
      cold silence. Her heart sank with a feeling of shame at her outburst. <i>Qui
      m'aime me suive</i> is sometimes an excellent battle-cry. When no one
      follows, it falls deadly flat. She realised that most of the people there
      knew her personal interest in the affair, and her cheek grew hotter.
      Roderick stepped boldly down to her, and whispered in her ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have the worshipping gratitude of all my life,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      A man rose at the back of the room and began to speak. There was a rustle
      of garments as every one turned to look at him. He was a well-known
      journalist, the editor of a weekly paper that made a specialty of
      diagnosing unsound institutions. Roderick tugged at his Vandyke beard and
      watched him narrowly. He began in a light bantering tone, described with
      delicate satiric touch the objects of the Colony. Then he playfully
      analysed the idyllic conditions under which the colonists would work. The
      meeting laughed. He sketched the boredom, the universal hatred of the
      minor poet who insisted on reading his poems aloud to the assembled
      Colony, the flirtations, imbroglios, jealousies, the lady who paid nothing
      and went about declaring that the food was not fit to eat. One by one he
      touched off the types. The meeting was delighted. Then the speaker
      launched out into a trenchant indictment of the whole scheme, disclosed
      its absurdity, its financial rottenness, its infinite futility. He ended
      amid rounds of laughter and applause. Ridicule had killed the scheme
      outright. There were cries that the motion should be put. It was carried
      almost by acclamation. Thus ended the great Walden Art Colony.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did think you would stand by it, Urquhart,&rdquo; said Roderick to the young
      semimillionaire.
    </p>
    <p>
      The people were beginning to disperse, among much laughter and gossip.
      Ella had lingered on an imploring sign from Roderick. Urquhart stifled a
      yawn and buttoned his frock-coat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear fellow,&rdquo; said he, from the heights of his superior culture, &ldquo;if
      you would only study Pradovitch,&mdash;&mdash; the one genius this century
      has produced,&mdash;study him as I have done, you would not fail to be
      convinced that Art is the leprosy of life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For once Roderick lost his temper. An evil look came into his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a God-forsaken fool you are!&rdquo; he snarled out. And turning on his
      heel he joined Ella.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man turned to Lord Eglington.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's the worst of having to do with such <i>canaille</i>,&rdquo; he said
      languidly. But in spite of his assumption of supercilious indifference,
      his face wore a malignant expression as he watched Roderick and his
      companion disappear through the doorway. At the door however, Roderick's
      indignation evaporated. It is no doubt an immense satisfaction to tell a
      posturing imbecile exactly what you, think of him, but when you have
      misappropriated a couple of thousands of that imbecile's money without any
      reasonable prospect of restoring it, the satisfaction is apt to be short
      hved.
    </p>
    <p>
      Roderick and Ella gained the street without saying a word. A cab sauntered
      up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you&mdash;?&rdquo; began Roderick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would sooner walk part of the way. Do you mind?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Delighted,&rdquo; said Roderick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The room was so hot,&rdquo; she explained, &ldquo;and it is a beautiful afternoon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They walked down Park Lane in silence, hanging dejected heads, a new Adam
      and Eve driven from Eden. Now and then she glanced sideways at him, to see
      his brow set and deep lines descending parallel with his moustache and
      losing themselves in his beard. His defeat seemed to have crushed him.
      Ella felt a pang of pity. She touched his arm lightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must not take it too much to heart,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must,&rdquo; he replied, with a gesture of despair. &ldquo;To think it should have
      all gone down like a house of cards!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They crossed the road and entered the Park. The grey mists of the early
      December afternoon were beginning to gather among the trees. Far off a
      great crimson blur announced the setting sun. To their right the statue of
      Achilles loomed grimly on its deserted hillock. Roderick pointed to it
      with his stick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you remember that Sunday afternoon six months ago, when all was hope
      and sunshine?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Redmayne had just joined,&rdquo; she remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And to-day he took the chair, so as to crush us. They had it all arranged
      beforehand. A damnable conspiracy! And we were powerless. It maddens me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His tones were those of intense feeling Ella was compelled to comfort.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You fought splendidly,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;A man can't do more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stopped abruptly in the path and laid both hands on her wrists by her
      muff. A belated nursery maid wheeling a perambulator eyed them dully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bless you for the words! You cannot tell what your sympathy means to me
      now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      By a happy chance he had struck the right note. Tears came into the girl's
      eyes. For the first time she was able to disassociate the man from his
      work. She lost her own sense of disappointment in womanly pity for the man
      who had been defeated while battling against great odds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And bless you for the tears standing in those eyes!&rdquo; said Roderick.
    </p>
    <p>
      They walked on. Somehow her hand found its way beneath his arm. They spoke
      but little. Roderick's pulses fluttered with a new hope; but his
      perceptions into the nature of women were too keen to allow him to force
      an advantage. He wore his stricken air, yet subtly conveyed to her the
      deep comfort of her sympathy. He pressed her hand against his side and
      left her to work out the situation for herself under these excellent
      conditions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ella had never felt so near him. The unity in their golden dreams had not
      bound them so closely as this unity in catastrophe. For even when the
      dreams were most golden, she had haunting misgivings that they were but
      visions. Outraged by Sylvester's trampling on her heart, sickened at
      herself by her years reckless follies, eager, with all a proud girl's
      passion, to vindicate herself, to follow some noble standard, she had
      caught at the first that flaunted by and compelled herself imperiously to
      believe in it. This forced faith had been the strenuous labour of her
      inner life. She had armed herself in triple brass against Lady Milmo's
      shafts of flippant satire, against Matthew Lanyon's kindly wisdom, against
      her own common sense. The Colony would be merely a paradise of cranks. No
      serious artist would throw away his or her career in such a
      Cloud-cuckoo-land.
    </p>
    <p>
      She herself, at the best but a well-taught amateur painter in
      water-colours, what was she doing in that galley? She set aside reason. To
      believe in Roderick, she must believe in the Colony. To believe in the
      Colony, she must believe in Roderick. The two were inextricably
      interfused. Realisation of the dreams was her only justification for
      marrying the man. The man's personality and enthusiasm for an ideal had
      overpowered her. She would not think. She was young, inexperienced,
      warm-natured, seeing things out of proportion. Flight from the self she
      had deemed dishonoured was her only chance of salvation; and she mistook
      the imaginary cries behind her, hounding her onward, for the voice of
      inexorable necessity. If Roderick could accomplish it, the Colony was a
      glorious thing. The Colony accomplished, Roderick was the conqueror to
      whom she must yield. When the dreams were most golden she saw him such,
      and they were near together.
    </p>
    <p>
      But then had come the days of Roderick's loss of interest in the scheme.
      He put her above the Colony, desired her above all things. She shivered
      back. For himself alone she could not marry him. Why, she could not tell.
      A girl with a mind pure and sweet does not speculate on that which, traced
      logically to its source, is simply elemental sexual repulsion. She clung
      fiercely to her point. Then Roderick returned to the scheme with his old
      ardour. In her heart she believed him passionately sincere. Misfortune had
      come with terrible unexpectedness. He had fought and failed. He was a
      beaten man. The dream had been brutally proved to have been the emptiest
      of hallucinations. She was miserably cast down. Roderick seemed
      broken-hearted. They were at one in an absolute cynical reality. Both had
      been pierced by the same shaft. The doors of the cranks' Eden had clanged
      behind them, and they were walking together in the grey, dreary expanse of
      Hyde Park, with an unknown world of the most definite prose before them.
      They seemed alone, to have nothing in common with the rest of society; to
      have in common with each other this all-filling humiliation of defeat. So
      when he spoke, the unreasoning woman leaped to comfort the man. She had
      never felt so near him. A great and natural revulsion of feeling had
      lifted her heart to consolation.
    </p>
    <p>
      They quitted the Park at Hyde Park Corner, and paused by common impulse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you will take a cab now,&rdquo; he said reluctantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose I must,&rdquo; she said in the same tone. &ldquo;I would ask you to come
      with me, but it's auntie's day at home, and the place will be full of
      chattering people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't bear leaving you,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor I you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You look tired, poor child. Let me give you some tea. Will you? I belong
      to a club in Piccadilly,&mdash;the Hyde Park, where ladies are admitted to
      tea. It is the home of all the depressed outcasts of London, and even they
      shun it. We are sure to be alone in the tea-room. Come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He hailed a hansom. Ella, in that strange mood of passivity which is
      woman's fatalest, entered without remark. He followed, and they drove to
      the Hyde Park Club.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he had prophesied, the tea-room was empty, save for one dejected member
      with his neck-tie riding over the back of his collar, who stared at them
      for a moment and then passed out like a ghost. A blazing fire, however,
      was burning in the grate, and the maroon leather chairs and divans added a
      sense of warmth and comfort to the room. The despondent ones took their
      seats in a little recess by the fireplace, and Roderick ordered tea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a new club, and no two members are acquainted. It is the most
      desolate place in London. A man comes here when he wants to work out his
      suicide. There's no one to distract his thoughts. Then he goes out and
      commits it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did you join?&rdquo; asked Ella, mechanically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps I foresaw this day. If your worshipped dearness had not waited
      for me at Urquhart's, I should have come here&mdash;and God knows what
      desperate remedies I should have brooded over. But I never foresaw having
      you here to strengthen me. Thank Heaven I did join, so as to have a haven
      of rest and quietude to bring you to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He passed his hand across his forehead wearily, and rested his elbow on
      the little table in front of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My God!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It has been a bitter day for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The waiter brought a tray with tea and delicately baked scones. Ella
      filled the cups and tried to cheer her companion, praising the tea and the
      arrangements of the club. The warmth, the little sense of novelty, working
      an unconscious influence, had brought back animation to her face. She
      looked very fresh and winsome in the man's eyes. They fixed themselves
      upon her despairingly. Ella suddenly broke off her trivial chatter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah you must not,&rdquo; she said, with a little choke to keep down the tears.
      &ldquo;There are so many great things left in the world to fight for&mdash;. Oh,
      I wish I could help you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bless you!&rdquo; he replied solemnly&mdash;and how much was acting, and how
      much was genuine, the man's Maker alone could tell, for the man himself
      could not; &ldquo;there is only one way in which you could help me, and that
      must not be. You are rich, I am poor. We are no longer working in the
      great common cause in which all such differences could have been sunk. As
      a man of honour I must release you from your engagement with me, for the
      conditions on which our engagement was based have lapsed. You are quite
      free, Ella, and I must go my way alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He hid his face in his hands. Ella trifled with her tea-spoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are generous,&rdquo; she said in a low voice. &ldquo;But if your honour is at
      stake, so is mine. I could not turn away from you in your hour of need.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am a defeated man,&rdquo; he replied brokenly. &ldquo;You would despise me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The word pierced her like a knife. At that moment she was noble, with the
      blind and piteous folly that is so often at the heart of woman's nobility.
      She drew herself up proudly, then stretched her arm impulsively across the
      table and closed her fresh young fingers on his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will marry you whenever you please, and we will face the world together
      and begin a new life,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My poor dear child,&rdquo; said Lady Milmo, kissing Ella affectionately, when
      she came home, &ldquo;I am so sorry for you. Lady Elstree came here straight
      after the meeting and told us all about it. But it was bound to come to
      smash, darling.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose it was, auntie,&rdquo; replied Ella, taking off her fur necklet.
    </p>
    <p>
      She sat down on the fender stool and looked into the fire. Lady Milmo came
      up and took one of her hands and petted it in her kindly fashion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm very glad it's all over,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;As soon as it became serious, I
      never liked it, you know, dear. And now we can start everything quite
      fresh, can't we?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, quite fresh,&rdquo; assented Ella.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see now,&rdquo; continued Lady Milmo, &ldquo;how wise it was to make that
      condition about your engagement. I don't want to say anything against
      Roderick, but he's an impossible visionary, dear. I always hated the idea
      of your marrying him. It is all broken off now, isn't it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To Lady Milmo's great astonishment, the girl suddenly burst into a fit of
      miserable crying. She knelt by her and petted her comfortingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will be quite easy, my child. I will write him a kind little note
      about it, and you can go down to Ayresford and take care of that dear
      Uncle Matthew of yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, auntie,&rdquo; cried Ella at last, &ldquo;you don't understand. I promised
      Roderick this afternoon to marry him in a fortnight's time.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIV&mdash;AT AYRESFORD
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>hilst the meeting
      was taking place that brought the Walden Art Colony to ludicrous collapse,
      Sylvester was on his way to Ayresford to pay one of his periodical
      Saturday to Monday visits. Matthew, with Dorothy clinging to his finger,
      met him at the station. Sylvester took the child up in his arms and kissed
      her, striving hard to respond to her demonstrations of affection. But his
      heart had turned from her. She was the embodiment of a perpetual pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sylvester's bag being taken in charge by the gardener's boy, the trio
      walked up to the house, Dorothy skipping between them. The old man looked
      proudly and lovingly down at her. Sylvester caught the glance from time to
      time, and a pang queerly like jealousy passed through him. If only he
      could love the small thing as he had loved her two years ago! But it was
      impossible. It was a question of blood instinct; she came of an alien
      race. He passed the house where he had lived with Constance, where Frank
      Leroux had died after the confession of his miserable secret. To the man's
      gloomy fancy it appeared a lie in brick. Only when he found himself alone
      with his father in the familiar library did he put away these imaginings
      and wear a clearer brow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope the marriage is as far off as ever,&rdquo; said Matthew, warming his
      hands before the fire. Sylvester laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems to be postponed to the Greek Kalends. She won't marry until he
      takes her to this Colony in the air&mdash;and that will be never. The
      whole thing will die a natural death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope so indeed,&rdquo; replied Matthew, reflectively. &ldquo;She ought to marry a
      better man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He glanced involuntarily at his son, and their eyes met, and each saw that
      the other understood the reference.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know you wanted me to marry her,&rdquo; said Sylvester, awkwardly. &ldquo;I
      couldn't. I'm sorry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Matthew raised his hand, as if about to speak; but the habit of reserve
      held him back. A word might have unlocked the son's heart, but the word
      remained unspoken. Sylvester dismissed the subject by saying in a lighter
      manner,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's none of my business, but I often wonder what Roderick lives on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is an artist and a literary man. I suppose he sells his wares,&rdquo; said
      Matthew.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Possibly he does. In fact, I suppose he must. I always was under the
      impression that his father made him a handsome allowance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Usher allows him a few hundreds a year,&rdquo; said the old man, in a
      matter-of-fact tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Apparently we are both wrong, then. Usher hasn't allowed him a penny for
      years. Roderick told me so himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Matthew started in his chair, and his face wore an expression of great
      anxiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Impossible!&rdquo; he said almost angrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I only quote Roderick's explicit statement. And I fancy for once in a way
      he wasn't lying.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he saw his father white and aged, his kind lips quivering, his breath
      coming fast. In concern he rose, bent over him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, you 're ill&mdash;&rdquo; he began.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Matthew pushed him away gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense, my boy. It's only one of those confounded pains about my heart.
      There, it's all gone now. Don't worry. It's this hot room. I think I'll go
      out for a stroll.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had better lie down,&rdquo; said the physician.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and stick out my tongue and chew that thermometer of yours! No,
      thank you. There!&rdquo; He rose to his feet, and held himself erect. &ldquo;I'm as
      strong as a horse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't like your going out,&rdquo; said Sylvester.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other looked at his watch. &ldquo;I must, for a bit,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Go up and
      talk to your aunt for an hour before dinner. She's dying to hear all the
      gossip.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was useless to try to restrain him. He had an imperious will to which
      Sylvester had yielded all his life. So the son went upstairs, and the
      father put on his overcoat and walked at a brisk pace through the dark
      December evening to the house of his enemy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Usher put down the &ldquo;Financial News&rdquo; and rose from his chair as Matthew
      entered the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear friend, how great a surprise! You have come for a reconciliation.
      It is a Christian thing. I too am a Christian, Matthew.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have come to ask you a question,&rdquo; said Matthew, ignoring the other's
      proffered hand. &ldquo;Roderick denies that he receives any allowance from you.
      Is that true?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am too poor to make my son an allowance,&rdquo; replied Usher.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know what I mean,&rdquo; replied Matthew, sternly. &ldquo;I pay £100 a quarter
      into your banking account for you to remit, as from yourself, to Roderick.
      Does he get it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ushers eyes shifted from Matthew's glance. He shuffled a step towards the
      fireplace before replying.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You outrage a father's feelings, Matthew. I live for my son. You yourself
      have a son.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Matthew strode up to him and laid a hand on his collar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Confound it, sir, answer my question! Roderick states that he hasn't
      received a penny from you for years. Have you kept all these sums back
      from him? By God! you shall speak.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Involuntarily he shook him in his angry grasp. Usher was scared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No violence, Matthew.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Matthew released him with a contemptuous exclamation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see by your face you have kept the money. I was a fool to trust you.
      You're an infernal mean-spirited hound. I've known that for years. But I
      never thought you would rob your son.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's not your son&mdash;At least,&rdquo; he added with an ugly smile, &ldquo;I
      presume not. I have trained him as I have thought judicious. I am a
      judicious man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You 're a damned thief,&rdquo; said Matthew. Usher waved his hand towards the
      door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you had better go. I do not like to see an old man so carried
      away by passion. It will shorten your life. I am always calm.&rdquo; Matthew
      regarded him for a moment, astounded. Then he spoke in blazing anger: &ldquo;<i>You</i>
      show <i>me</i> the door? <i>You?</i> Sit down in that chair at once.&rdquo;
       Usher obeyed. &ldquo;There! I stay in this house as long as I choose. It is
      mine,&mdash;everything in it paid for with my heart's blood. By God, if we
      were younger men, I should thrash you within an ace of your life! Now then&mdash;let
      me see your passbooks for the last six years. Give them to me at once, I
      say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Instinctively Usher shrank before Matthew's tone of authority. He rose,
      whimpering allusions to his own poverty and Matthew's domineering ways,
      and extracted a set of vellum-covered books from a safe in a corner of the
      room. Matthew threw his hat and stick upon a chair, and sat down, by the
      round table on which Usher had laid the books. The latter resumed his
      armchair on the opposite side and watched him furtively as he scanned the
      pages with practised eye and bent brows. When Matthew was dangerous, he
      had no power to resist. The craven within him yielded to the stronger
      personality. But he hated Matthew with a deadlier hatred. Even now, in the
      moment of his humiliation, there was a gleam in his eyes of a revengeful
      joy at the imperious man's discovery of the manner in which he had been
      fooled for years past. He rubbed his palms softly together beneath the
      level of the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a dead silence, broken only by the faint rustling of the leaves
      as Matthew turned them over. At last, when he had looked through the
      books, he rose and returned his glasses to their little leather case. His
      face was gray and peaked. There on the table lay incontrovertible proof
      that his life's atonement had been frustrated, that instead of smoothing
      Roderick's path, he had merely been pandering to Usher's senile vices. A
      whole fortune had gone in insane speculations, rotten companies for the
      exploitation of imaginary mines, futile inventions, wild-cat schemes. Here
      and there were amounts for £100, £200, paid to names which he recognised
      as those of great postage-stamp dealers. Not once had a cheque been drawn
      payable to Roderick. On the credit side were two large sums which he
      himself had paid to extricate Roderick from special difficulties. On the
      debit side was nothing to correspond. He felt stricken with sudden age.
      But he drew himself up haughtily lest Usher should see his despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you have been lying, I perceive,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;when you have come to me
      for money to pay Roderick's debts,&mdash;or else you haven't paid them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have paid them all&mdash;all his debts&mdash;with securities, Matthew.
      That is why nothing is in my pass-book.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Matthew shrugged his shoulders contemptuously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your word is about as good as your bond,&rdquo; he said, taking up his hat and
      stick.
    </p>
    <p>
      Usher rose and leaned his hands on the table and regarded him
      reproachfully, wagging his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could not blacken the character of my only son, Matthew. He has been
      wild, but I have a parent's love. Why should I give him £400 a year when
      he did not need it? But when he has come to me in distress, I have
      relieved his necessities.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have learned all I wanted to know,&rdquo; said Matthew. &ldquo;Good-night to you.&rdquo;
       And he strode out of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      An hour or two later he was sitting alone with Sylvester over their wine,
      in the comfortable dining-room, as he had done so many, many times before,&mdash;and
      the same silence reigned between them. He lay back in his chair and
      watched his son, whose face was turned from him in half profile. He
      wondered what were the thoughts that held him so serious, as he gazed into
      the fire. It was a man's face, marked with the cares of life, the
      responsibilities of an anxious profession; proud, reserved, and
      intellectual. Matthew was immensely proud of him. In this hour of relaxed
      moral fibre, he was humbly grateful, wondered what pleasure a brilliant
      man like Sylvester could find in the company of a dull old country lawyer.
      It was only the love between them. His heart warmed towards his son, and a
      foolish moisture gathered in his eyes. And then, almost suddenly, came a
      great longing to tell Sylvester all. He was a physician, accustomed to
      view the dark places in the human soul. If only he could tell him, share
      with him the burden he had borne for so many years! It would no longer be
      a burden. He would face the world at last, a free man. For otherwise what
      would be the end? He himself was on the verge of ruin. He might spit upon
      Usher's gaberdine, but Usher's demands must be met. How to meet them and
      preserve an inheritance for Sylvester? And Roderick? He felt crushed by
      this evening's revelations. He had struggled as few men have struggled to
      make atonement. It had been in vain. He had no longer the strength to make
      fresh effort. A word to Sylvester, and peace would possess his soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sylvester glanced round and saw his father's eyes fixed upon him with a
      strange yearning. He rose, went up to his chair, and laid a hand upon his
      shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What can I do for you?&rdquo; he asked, with more tenderness than usual in his
      tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think well of me when I am gone, Syl,&rdquo; said the old man. Sylvester
      grasped his shoulder a little tighter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's a strange thing to ask me,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You know what I think of
      you. And for God's sake don't talk of the other matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He moved away and struck a match to relight his cigar, which had gone out
      during his reverie. Matthew was silent for a few seconds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose,&rdquo; he said at last, &ldquo;that any one you loved and thought the world
      of had done you a great wrong and had kept it hidden from you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sylvester started, and his face grew suddenly pale. Did his father know?
      The old pain returned. He stood staring at the back of his father's chair.
      The match burned itself out between his fingers. His voice trembled as he
      spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are some sins that are unforgivable. We needn't discuss them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was Matthew's turn to start and look round at his son in anxious
      surmise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are of course speaking of the matter in the abstract?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sylvester struck another match, and spoke between the first few whiffs of
      his cigar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. In the abstract. There is the woman, for instance, who betrays her
      husband, whose life is a horrible lie. To say to a man 'forgive,' is vain
      breath. I know men who say they have forgiven. They are almost as
      contemptible as their wives.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would not forgive, Syl?&rdquo; said Matthew, gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By God, no!&rdquo; said Sylvester.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right, my boy,&rdquo; said Matthew. &ldquo;We had better not pursue the
      subject. Abstract ethics are unprofitable matter for discussion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He smiled in his kindly way and settled himself comfortably in his chair.
      But his heart was twenty-fold heavier than before. He closed his eyes. The
      memory came vividly of a woman throwing herself on her knees before him,
      in that very room, several years ago, and pouring out to him the agony of
      her soul. He had listened, questioned, bidden her go and sin no more. For
      Sylvester's sake he had counselled silence, secret atonement. It had been
      unutterable comfort to him that Sylvester's happiness had been untouched.
      And now, in spite of all, Sylvester knew. Else why should Sylvester have
      spoken thus of the faithless wife? The vague conjecture that had haunted
      him for nearly two years shaped itself into certainty. Many things that
      had been dark in Sylvester's recent life now became clear. But how he must
      have suffered! None knew better than he. For a while he forgot his own
      burden. Then suddenly the memory returned. But no longer had he the desire
      to share it with Sylvester. It was more imperative than ever to keep the
      secret undivulged. It was no new thing for him to struggle and endure. And
      the man of iron purpose and pathetic tenderness felt ashamed of his former
      impulse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm afraid we've been talking a pack of nonsense, Syl,&rdquo; he said lightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And we're both old enough to know better,&rdquo; replied Sylvester, with a
      laugh. &ldquo;How did we get on to the subject?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I began to croak in an absurd way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I'm afraid I helped you. I must come down here oftener. That dingy
      old house of mine is getting on my nerves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, bosh!&rdquo; said the old man, &ldquo;you and I don't believe in nerves. We leave
      that to the feeble folk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I haven't got many, I must confess,&rdquo; said Sylvester, drawing up his
      well-knit figure. &ldquo;And as a matter of fact, except your seediness, I
      haven't a care in the whole wide world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Neither have I,&rdquo; returned Matthew, briskly. &ldquo;And as for my health, I'm as
      fit as ever I was. Oh, I know I can't live for ever, but I'm good for
      another ten years at least.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've got to be careful and do what you 're told,&rdquo; said the physician.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let's have another glass of port before we go up to Agatha,&rdquo; said
      Matthew, reaching out for the decanter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus father and son tried to throw dust into each other's eyes, so that
      each should regard the other as the happiest of men.
    </p>
    <p>
      The servant entered, bearing a tray with the letters that had arrived by
      the evening post. Matthew glanced at the addresses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you excuse me?&rdquo; he said courteously. And Sylvester, trained in a
      brusquer school of manners, felt a great respect for his father's
      old-world politeness to a guest. Matthew opened two envelopes and glanced
      cursorily at their contents. Over the third letter he paused, and his lips
      twitched as he read. Then without comment he handed it to Sylvester.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a long letter from Ella, written that morning. Amid many feminine
      explanations and ambiguities she announced the fact of the downfall of the
      Walden Art Colony and her marriage with Roderick in a fortnight's time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This upsets all my calculations,&rdquo; said Sylvester, gravely. &ldquo;I thought the
      affair was as good as broken off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is only natural,&rdquo; said Matthew.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Natural! How?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The chivalry of woman, Syl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Respect kept Sylvester from contradiction, but his lips curled somewhat
      ironically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If a woman won't have a man when he is up, will she rush into his arms
      when he is down?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It often happens, my boy,&rdquo; replied the old man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sylvester took one or two turns about the room. Then he paused by the
      table and lifted his wine-glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here's to our friend Roderick's confusion,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I'm afraid I have
      been slack in carrying out your wishes, but now I'll use every means in my
      power to stop the marriage.&rdquo; Matthew deliberately set down the glass which
      he happened to be holding in his hand, and remained for a moment in deep
      thought. Then he spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't drink a toast like that, nor must you. I release you entirely
      from your promise. I have reason to believe I may have misjudged Roderick,
      and I have no right to interfere. It is my wish that the marriage should
      take place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was final. Sylvester made an Englishman's awkward little bow of
      acquiescence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no personal feelings in the matter, as you are aware,&rdquo; said he.
      &ldquo;On the other hand, if Roderick should be proved to be&mdash;well, as
      undesirable as you thought, it would be wise to let Ella know, I suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would not have her marry a scamp,&rdquo; replied Matthew, in a low voice. &ldquo;It
      would break my heart. But, O God! Syl, what is a scamp? Which of us dare
      judge his fellow?&rdquo; He was feeling utterly weary, and from his prostration
      came the personal utterance which his ordinary strength rigidly
      restrained.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sylvester, unaware of the stirring of great depths, replied coldly, &ldquo;A man
      with a clean record behind him, like either of us, is certainly in a
      position to judge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And pity?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pity generally seems to be an elegant method of condoning those offences
      which one has in common with the person pitied,&rdquo; replied Sylvester.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So that when you are stainless you are pitiless?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the sense of sympathising with evil in any form&mdash;yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the old man, throwing himself back in his chair and covering
      his eyes with his hand, &ldquo;thank God there's still some sin left in the
      world to keep it sweet!&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XV&mdash;A STRIP OF PINK PAPER
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span> few days
      afterwards Sylvester received an invitation to the wedding, accompanied by
      a despairing note from Lady Milmo. Ella <i>would</i> do it, and who could
      prevent her? When a woman was <i>bent</i> on a thing, especially <i>matrimony</i>,
      no mule in the world was so <i>obstinate</i>. Lady Milmo italicised
      freely, &ldquo;obstinate&rdquo; being doubly underlined. She hoped, however, that the
      lovers would be happy, explained that the wedding would be as quiet as her
      enormous circle of acquaintance would allow, and besought Sylvester to
      come and support her as the only soul that sympathised with her in this
      disastrous occurrence. Sylvester read the letter through somewhat grimly.
      Then he glanced at the silver-printed card. The conjuncture of the names
      caused him a sudden feeling of repugnance, and with an impulse he did not
      seek to explain, he threw the card into the fire. As for the invitation,
      he declined it on the score of professional engagements; also because he
      disapproved of marriage in the abstract. If all the race for one
      generation, he wrote, passed a self-denying ordinance of celibacy, there
      would be an end of this miserable thing that was called humanity.
    </p>
    <p>
      On receipt of this letter, Lady Milmo smiled astutely and took advantage
      of a confidential hour before bedtime to tread upon delicate ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall always wonder why you refused Sylvester Lanyon, Ella,&rdquo; she said
      meditatively.
    </p>
    <p>
      The blood flew angrily into Ella's cheeks, and she turned away her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never refused him because he never did me the honour to ask me to marry
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps he needed a little encouragement, dear,&rdquo; said Lady Milmo,
      somewhat taken aback.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He needs a lot to make a man of him that only his Maker could give him,&rdquo;
       replied Ella, turning round vindictively. &ldquo;His blood is a kind of Condy's
      Fluid, and his heart is a glass retort. He's just a piece of sentient
      mechanism. How do you think a man like that could ask a girl to marry
      him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, he did once,&rdquo; murmured Lady Milmo.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was different then,&rdquo; said Ella, with a queer little shock of pain. &ldquo;I
      used to like him. But now&mdash;now there is no one in the whole wide
      world I dislike so much. Sometimes when he comes here and talks to me in
      that cold, emotionless voice of his, I absolutely hate him. And if it
      wasn't for my dear old Uncle Matthew&mdash;&rdquo; she broke off and rang the
      bell for her maid. &ldquo;It's about time to go to bed, auntie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Milmo made no response. A flash of the truth occurred to her; but the
      whole matter of Ella's state of mind was very complicated. She yawned
      behind gracefully lifted Angers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think so too, my dear,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      They bade each other good-night, and Ella fell asleep while cataloguing
      the infirmities of the man whom she was not about to marry.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man whom she was to marry in ten days' time was meanwhile passing
      through a period of sweet delight alternating with the most poignant
      anxiety. Ready money for the ordinary expenses of the wedding he had in
      plenty. Some overdue royalties on prints from a couple of pictures came in
      most opportunely, and these, added to an advance made by a friendly editor
      for whose weekly he wrote the art article, put him beyond the fear of
      embarrassment. But the thought of the £3,000 which he could not restore,
      haunted him night and day. Urquhart had twice asked casually for a cheque
      for the amount of his deposit, and he had promised in his off-hand way. A
      third demand had been made somewhat threateningly; he had laughed airily,
      apologised for his forgetfulness, and undertaken to send him a cheque for
      £2000 by return of post. After that Roderick avoided his club and the
      haunts where he was likely to meet Urquhart.
    </p>
    <p>
      That was three days ago. Roderick hoped that Urquhart would not renew his
      request till after his marriage. Then he could obtain a large sum from
      Ella, who would be no longer under Matthew Lanyon's trusteeship, but would
      be free to dispose of her money as she chose. Besides, no man would pester
      another for money during his honeymoon. He would have ample time to
      arrange things. He had been rather sore at Matthew's absolute refusal to
      allow Ella to make any marriage settlements. Not that he had taken the
      initiative in the matter. Matthew himself had done so, in a friendly
      letter in which he referred to the greater dignity and feeling of
      independence of the man upon whom none of his wife's fortune had been
      settled. Roderick had acquiesced with good grace, and in his heart wished
      that he really possessed the delicacy of sentiment that would have made
      his deprecation of such things as marriage settlements genuine. For he had
      grown to love Ella genuinely, and he hated himself for counting on her
      money.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just one week more, dear, and then we shall begin our new life together.&rdquo;
       So ran a sentence of a letter from Ella, which Roderick was reading at
      breakfast. He sighed, rested his elbows on the table and his chin in his
      hands, his yellow beard protruding over his fingers, and gazed sadly over
      the elegantly set meal. Their new life! He was past forty, past the age of
      fresh ideals. Hitherto his had been the gratification of the lust of the
      eyes and the lust of the flesh. At times he deceived himself, an exuberant
      mood carrying its own persuasiveness. But there were hours, and they had
      been very frequent of late, when he saw himself as he was and hated the
      picture. A <i>poseur</i>, a sham, a creature of imperfect moral sense;
      gifted, it is true, with certain artistic faculties, wherewith he imposed
      upon a superficial world and so made his living; but insincere, devoid of
      real enthusiasms, cynically despising the gospel that he preached. For the
      first time he had touched a fervent and earnest soul, and the sense of his
      responsibility overwhelmed him. He rose and looked into the Empire mirror
      over the fireplace. He was middle-aged, puffed, wrinkled, worn out. There
      could be no new ideals,&mdash;only a reattiring of the old shams that had
      peopled his life. He threw himself down in an armchair and read Ella's
      letter through again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My God,&rdquo; said he, from his heart, as a million futile men have said, &ldquo;if
      only I had ordered my life differently!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A trim maid-servant, one of the staff of the mansions in which his
      chambers were situated, entered with the announcement of a visitor. A
      moment afterwards Bevis Urquhart came in, languid, supercilious, with an
      ugly expression on his flabby face. Roderick rose, assumed at once his
      jaunty manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down, my dear friend. You come like a ray of morning sunshine
      piercing through the fog.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Urquhart put his hat on the table and unbuttoned his gloves. &ldquo;No, I won't
      sit down, thank you,&rdquo; he drawled. &ldquo;My brougham is at the door, and I'm in
      a hurry. I rather want that subscription back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, my dear fellow, you 're worse than a bankrupt bootmaker,&rdquo; cried
      Roderick, pleasantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps I am, but I want the money,&rdquo; replied the young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll send you a cheque this afternoon, 'pon my soul,&rdquo; said
      Roderick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've told me that before, Usher. I want you to write the cheque now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Roderick looked him between the eyes, and threw off his mask of
      cordiality.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose I say I don't like your tone, and will see you damned before I do
      otherwise than suit my own convenience?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I shall conclude you have bagged the money and can't repay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are insulting,&rdquo; said Roderick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe I am stating facts. It was rather odd your meeting those bills
      that Willie Lathrop backed, just at that time, wasn't it?&rdquo; Roderick again
      cursed Willie Lathrop under his breath. He turned aside and lit a
      cigarette, so as to gain time. Then he forced a laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, come, Urquhart. This is all nonsense. It was too large a sum to
      leave idle at my bankers,&mdash;besides, there's always a risk, you know,&mdash;so
      I invested it,&mdash;in Trust Funds, of course. One can't buy and sell
      stock over a counter. There are delays of correspondence. And I've been so
      devilish busy with wedding preparations, you know, that I haven't attended
      to it. I'll write at once to my broker. There.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Urquhart listened with an incredulous smile. He gathered up his hat and
      gloves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sometimes it pleases me to act the Godforsaken fool you did yourself the
      pleasure to call me. Sometimes it doesn't. I'll give you till to-morrow
      night to send me your cheque for £2,000 with the per cent interest. If you
      don't&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my dear friend, what if I don't?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll publish it all over London that you have bagged the money&mdash;and
      make sure that Miss Defries hears it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what if I kick you down the ten flights of stairs of these mansions?&rdquo;
       snarled Roderick, his hands clenched and the sweat standing on his
      forehead through the effort to maintain self-control.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll publish it at once,&rdquo; said the young man, languidly. &ldquo;Good day,
      Usher. Till tomorrow evening, then?&rdquo; He nodded superciliously and
      disappeared, leaving his enemy impotent with wrath and fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Revengeful devil!&rdquo; he exclaimed stupidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The servant came in to clear away the breakfast things. Roderick pushed
      aside the <i>portiere</i> and went into his studio. The great window was
      open. He stood by it, heedless of the raw, damp air. From beneath the veil
      of fog came the uncanny rumbling of the traffic in the street. Everything
      was hidden. He seemed to be an immeasurable height from the earth. All
      below was abysmal, inscrutable.
    </p>
    <p>
      A thought shuddered through his being. One plunge into the unknown, and
      the sordid fears of living would be at an end. But the fog made him cough,
      and the tiny check threw him back again, like a wheel, into his normal
      groove. He shut the window and walked moodily to the studio fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two thousand pounds had to be obtained by to-morrow night. Otherwise,
      social disaster and loss of Ella. He had not the faith to trust her with
      his wretched story. &ldquo;I promised to marry a gentleman, and not a thief,&rdquo; he
      heard her saying. The tone of her voice stabbed him with a greater pain
      than he had thought himself capable of feeling. There was only one way out
      of it,&mdash;another appeal to his father. He would go down to Ayresford
      at once. It was characteristic of him that he shivered at the thought of
      the comfortless journey.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few hours later he stood, white and haggard, in the porch of Mr. Usher's
      house, bidding his father good-bye. It was fresh and clear at Ayresford,
      and the gathering twilight deepened the country hush of things.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've always looked upon myself as a bad lot, but compared with you I'm an
      innocent babe,&rdquo; said Roderick, in a queer, low voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man put out a deprecatory hand and looked at his son out of
      expressionless blue eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I only point the way, my son. These reverses on the Stock Exchange have
      brought me near to penury. I look forward to your marriage, so that you
      can provide for your poor old father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You could easily have lent me the money,&rdquo; muttered Roderick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have shown you how to obtain it. Do not fear Matthew Lanyon, my son. We
      are not friends, and I will meet him no longer. But he is a snake with the
      fangs drawn; and I have drawn them. I have power over men. It is my way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a touch of savage exultation in the old man's tone which was new
      to Roderick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are quite sure about it?&rdquo; he asked quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He would not dare to hurt a hair of my dear boy's head.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What the devil is this hold you have got over him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll leave that to you as your inheritance, my son.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Roderick watched the old, ignoble figure with a feeling of horrible
      repulsion. He turned, bidding him an abrupt farewell, and walked fast
      through the garden and out at the gate on to the road that led to the
      station. At the refreshment bar he drank a shilling's worth of brandy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Late that night he went into his club,&mdash;not the desolate Hyde Park
      where he had drunk tea with Ella,&mdash;but the little Belvidere in St.
      James's Street where they talk Art in Gothic capitals and play &ldquo;bridge&rdquo;
       for high stakes. As he had hoped, he found Urquhart in the smoking-room
      surrounded by half a dozen men who formed the esoteric ring of the club.
      The young semi-millionaire was holding forth on his newly discovered
      genius, Pradovitch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thought rapt, deep, unexpressive,&mdash;that is the only medium for the
      soul. The only ideal of life is to express all consciousness in terms of
      abstract and absolute thought&mdash;I don't know if I make myself clear.
      But that in vulgar language is his doctrine. As for Art, what is it but
      the scum that rises to the surface of the pure well of thought?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, rot!&rdquo; exclaimed young Willie Lathrop, rising with a yawn. &ldquo;The Venus
      of Milo and Beethoven are good enough for me. Let's have a flutter. Hallo,
      Usher&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Roderick came forward, elegant in his evening dress and great white bow,
      and suave in manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; he said formally, in a voice that commanded attention, &ldquo;I am
      glad to find you all here. Urquhart came to my rooms this morning and
      expressed himself in a manner that I am sure he will see calls for a
      public apology. I take you all to witness that I hand him my cheque for
      £2,050, being the amount he deposited with me as his subscription to the
      funds of the Walden Art Colony, together with the interest on the same.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And with his grandest gesture he held out the cheque to Urquhart. There
      was a great silence as every one looked at the young man to see what he
      would do. He took the cheque, eyed it for a moment, and then met
      Roderick's mocking glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is quite correct?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite,&rdquo; said Urquhart; and then somewhat desperately, &ldquo;I have much
      pleasure in withdrawing anything I said this morning that you may have
      objected to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hooray!&rdquo; cried Lathrop. &ldquo;Now shake hands, you two, and be friends again.
      And Urquhart shall stand the crowd supper on the interest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And so peace was concluded. But Roderick did not sleep that night, and the
      next day it was torture to meet a girl's honest eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      She noticed his preoccupation, was tenderly solicitous. What were his
      anxieties?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I have any, they are lest any unforeseen disaster should occur between
      now and Wednesday,&rdquo; he replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, what should come?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is only a man's inability to realise that such happiness can ever be
      his.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He burst into rapturous speech, carrying the girl with him on its flood.
      For the moment she forgot his troubled look, and when he had gone her
      attention was absorbed by practical details. In fact, during these days of
      hurried preparation, the material affairs of life were sufficient for her
      content. Countless letters had to be written, innumerable purchases to be
      made, plans for future living to be discussed. At no time does modern
      civilisation allow sentiment to come less within a woman's spiritual
      horizon than during the week before her marriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      As usually happens, the wedding preparations extended far beyond the
      original design. The guest list swelled day by day. Instead of a mere
      vicar, Lady Milmo's favourite colonial bishop was engaged for the
      ceremony. The bridesmaids increased in number from two to six. The meeting
      of a few intimates at Lady Milmo's to drink the bride and bridegroom's
      health was gradually magnified into a vast reception for which the house
      was being turned upside down. On one point Ella remained firm. She would
      be married in a travelling dress. Then there were after arrangements to be
      considered. Lady Milmo's old friends, Lord and Lady Greatorex, who were
      wintering in Cairo, had put their little place in Shropshire at the
      disposal of the young couple for their honeymoon. When they came back to
      London, they would take a furnished flat until a house could be found to
      suit them; but the furnished flat had first to be obtained. The days
      passed in a whirl of occupation, and when Ella laid her head upon the
      pillow at night, sheer physical fatigue sent her forthwith to sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once she was touched to tears. Matthew Lanyon had given her a magnificent
      present which already stood on the special table in the morning room. But
      he had also sent her an intimate gift, a little ruby ring, with a letter
      of tender affection. &ldquo;It belonged to my dear wife,&rdquo; he wrote; &ldquo;and I could
      give you nothing dearer to me,&mdash;perhaps it symbolises a drop of my
      heart's blood.... I would come to your wedding, my dear, but this old
      machine is getting cracked and wheezy, and is at present laid up for
      repairs. I must get Sylvester to come and mend me. But all my love will be
      with you.&rdquo; And that night she sat up late in her room writing him a long,
      long letter, pouring out her heart to him, as she had never done before.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The letter reached him on Monday morning. He had been suffering
      considerably, and Sylvester was there, having made hasty arrangements for
      the care of his patients in town. Matthew submitted to confinement to the
      house, but insisted on getting up for breakfast. Bed was not the proper
      place for a man to eat in, he declared, and nothing but main force would
      have kept him there. So he sat down to table and made a valiant pretence
      at eating, while Miss Lanyon cast appealing glances at Sylvester and
      suggested arrow-root, and beef-tea, and eggs, and brandy, at intervals.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you hint at any more horrors, Agatha,&rdquo; said the old man, looking up
      from his letter, &ldquo;I'll go to the office.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The white reflected glare from a slight fall of snow that covered the lawn
      filled the comfortable dining-room. Miss Lanyon glanced through the French
      window and shivered. Matthew was quite capable of carrying out his threat.
      She refrained from further suggestions, and meanwhile Matthew finished his
      letter in peace.
    </p>
    <p>
      He folded it up when he had read it and put it in his pocket. He felt
      happier. Ella had revealed to him a Roderick that he had never realised.
      The girl's early struggles showed that she had mistrusted him. Now she had
      arrived at the man's heart and found it loyal and worthy. A fluttering at
      the glass caused him to rise and gather up a handful of breadcrumbs for
      the birds. Having thrown it out on to the lawn, he closed the window and
      stood watching the feast, Dorothy by his side. It was a bright morning,
      the sun shining from a pale blue sky and glinting on the myriad facets of
      the snow. The red clusters on a holly bush and the breasts of a couple of
      robins among the fluttering birds made tiny specks of colour against the
      white. The earth was sweet. Matthew felt a sense of exhilaration. After
      all, perhaps this was the great reparation that through his indirect
      agency had been accomplished. Materially, Roderick was relieved for life
      from the sordid cares of poverty; and spiritually, if ever woman could
      raise a man's soul to gentler things, that woman was Ella Defries. His
      life had not been wholly lived in vain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon his managing clerk brought the office letters. They retired to the
      library, and Matthew threw himself with more spirit into affairs than he
      had been able to show for some time past. At twelve o'clock Sylvester
      entered with some medicine. He found his father alone, writing hard amid a
      sea of papers. A professional rebuke induced him to desist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you write another line, I'll go straight back to London,&rdquo; said
      Sylvester.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are much more needed there than you are here, I assure you,&rdquo; said the
      old man. &ldquo;I'm as fit as ever I was.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But he blotted his letter and put his papers by, and pushing his
      writing-chair away from the table settled himself comfortably for a chat.
      He was full of small interests this morning. There had been fine doings,
      he had learned, the evening before, at the Town Council. The idiots had
      actually voted against the Free Library that he had schemed out in every
      particular. Hodgkins, the progressive butcher, whose face was like a
      hollyhock, had said that he blushed to bear the name of Englishman in
      common with them. Matthew wondered how he did it. All the same, he must
      get about again and put some sense into the Council.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't quite know why they listen to me, but they do,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then there were other matters. Jenkins's wife was laid up. That made the
      tenth child. Would Sylvester make arrangements for the three youngest
      children to board with the Jellicoes as usual?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can Jenkins afford it?&rdquo; asked Sylvester.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course not. Otherwise what would be the sense of our arranging
      things?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sylvester assented. The old man launched out into an invective against all
      the ne'er-do-weels of Ayresford who procreated large families which they
      could not support and spent their small earnings in drink. The brutes!
      Boiling oil was too dreamy a death for them. As Sylvester knew that any
      man of them would, if bidden, have licked his father's boots, he smoked
      his pipe imperturbably, unaffected by this outburst of ferocity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose all this is pretty parochial,&rdquo; said Matthew, at length, &ldquo;but
      it's a bit of the cosmos, anyhow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a knock at the door, and one of his clerks appeared with a small
      leather-covered book. Matthew took it from him and laid it on the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take all this stuff to Mr. Findlay,&rdquo; he said, indicating a pile of
      papers. The clerk gathered them up and withdrew.
    </p>
    <p>
      Matthew continued his parable, but his fingers played with the banker's
      pass-book.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse me for a moment, while I see how the balance stands,&rdquo; he said at
      last.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sylvester nodded and stretched himself comfortably behind the morning
      paper. A few moments passed. Then suddenly he heard a choking sound and
      the violent creak of a chair. He started to his feet. There was his father
      fallen limp over the arm of the chair, while from his nerveless fingers a
      strip of pink paper fluttered to the ground.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVI&mdash;AT BAY
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>t was not until
      the evening that Sylvester entered the library again. His father was still
      unconscious, likely to remain so for many hours. Matthew's ordinary
      medical adviser had consulted with Sylvester. A trained nurse telegraphed
      for from London had just arrived. At present nothing more could be done.
      Possibly the stricken man might recover. But the case was grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sylvester had been puzzled all day. What could have induced the stroke? A
      moment or two before, his father had been in the best of spirits, talking
      with an enjoyment that had been very rare of late. Generally, when the
      heart is weak, it is some sudden shock that paralyses. But here the theory
      of sudden shock was untenable. Perhaps it was simply the reaction of the
      high spirits following depression.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Lanyon and himself had dined together,&mdash;a cheerless meal. The
      gentle lady wept and conjectured feebly as to causation, implored
      Sylvester, as indeed she had done all day, to pronounce favourably on the
      patient's condition. They did not eat much. The cook had sent up tearful
      apologies for the spoiling of a dish, on the ground that she was too
      upset. But they would not have noticed. The parlour maid's eyes were red.
      She had been some years in the house, and the personal charm that endeared
      Matthew to all who came in contact with him had gained the girl's
      affection. Miss Lanyon used to say that Matthew spoiled the servants.
      Matthew replied that he hated perfection, and liked them spoiled; they
      were more human. At any rate, his sudden illness spread consternation and
      dismay through the household. The news had gone abroad, and anxious
      inquiries had been made at the door by all kinds and conditions of folk.
      Amongst them was Mr. Usher, who had shuffled up to hear news of his dear
      friend in affliction. Sylvester had sent him a curt reply by the servant.
      He disliked Mr. Usher cordially, and had rejoiced over the strained
      relations that had kept him away from the house. Dinner was over, and
      Sylvester went into the library to smoke. The room was more or less as he
      had left it that morning. Matthew's pass-book lay on the table, and three
      or four passed cheques lay upon the book. He filled and lit his pipe, and
      sat down in the writing-chair to think over the case. Suddenly, the room
      recalling associations, he remembered the cheque he had seen flutter from
      his father's fingers. Almost idly he looked down to see if it was still on
      the floor. His eye fell upon it underneath the armchair, whither it had
      probably been kicked during the bodily removal of his father from the
      room. He picked it up. But a glance was enough to make him start back with
      an oath. It was a passed cheque for £3,000 made payable to and indorsed by
      Roderick Usher, and signed &ldquo;Matthew Lanyon.&rdquo; At first he could not
      comprehend it. Why should his father have paid to Roderick so amazing a
      sum? And having paid it, why should he have received such a shock on
      seeing the cheque? He brought it nearer the lamp that stood on the table;
      and then, suddenly, a suspicion smote him, like a great blow. There were
      variations from his father's writing. His signature, so simple as to be
      roughly imitated with the greatest facility, had yet certain strong
      characteristics which were missing here. Sylvester looked at the numbers
      of the cheques on the table; they were consecutive. The three thousand
      pound cheque bore a number from a totally different series. The pink
      colour, too, was slightly faded. Where was the book from which the cheque
      had been torn? His glance fell upon his father's bunch of keys, depending
      from one in the lock of the writing-table drawer. An idea struck him. He
      remembered that his father, most methodical of men, kept the stubs of his
      cheque-books ranged along a shelf of an old press between the fireplace
      and the window. For a moment he hesitated. He had never looked at one of
      his father's papers in his life. His intention seemed almost criminal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon, my dear, but I must,&rdquo; he said, half aloud, and then
      finding the key he opened the cupboard. A rapid examination showed him the
      stub he wanted. The dates on the counterfoils were of three years back.
      With trembling fingers he ran through the numbers. The counterfoil of
      Roderick's cheque was missing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mechanically he replaced the stub and locked the cupboard. And then he
      stood for a while, fierce-eyed, shivering with a horrible certainty.
      Roderick had forged the cheque, and the shock of discovery had nearly
      killed his father.
    </p>
    <p>
      The whole man was white-hot with fury. In such accesses of anger, stern,
      reserved men have killed their enemies mercilessly. Instead of confusing
      their judgment, their anger burns it to crystal clearness. Every action is
      that of sublimated reason. Sylvester remained for a few moments
      motionless; then he picked up a railway time-card from the table, glanced
      at it, and consulted his watch. He turned down the lamp and left the room.
      In the hall he was met by Simmons, the doctor. The latter was by far the
      more outwardly perturbed of the two.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, how are things?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As satisfactory as can be expected,&rdquo; replied Sylvester. &ldquo;Come and see.&rdquo;
       They went together slowly up the stairs, discussing the symptoms, and
      entered the sick chamber. There was very little change. Unconsciousness
      would still last for many hours. That at least was certain. Meanwhile they
      could do nothing but await events. Before leaving the room, Sylvester bent
      down and kissed his father's face, that looked shrunken in the dim light,
      and never had he felt such yearning love for him. Downstairs, he drew
      Simmons into the library.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going to London to-night,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      Simmons stared at him. &ldquo;To London?&rdquo; he queried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And leave my father in this condition? Yes, I am summoned on a matter of
      life and death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The other was puzzled by the non-professional phrase. &ldquo;An urgent case&rdquo;
       would have been intelligible. But he made no comment. Neither of the
      Lanyons was a man to discuss his private concerns with his acquaintance.
      Sylvester continued,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am more than satisfied to leave him in your hands, Simmons. You know
      that. But you would be doing me a good turn if you sent me two or three
      telegrams to-morrow. I hope to get back at night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Willingly,&rdquo; replied Simmons; and after a few more words, the two men
      shook hands and parted. Miss Lanyon, whose simple gospel it was that
      whatever Matthew or Sylvester did was right, demanded no explanations when
      Sylvester announced his intention of going to London; but when he was
      gone, she cried a bit to herself in a sympathetic feminine way. Men were
      unaccountable beings in her eyes. They represented mysterious forces which
      she had been brought up, in her young days, to regard with respectful awe.
      There was a trace of orientalism in the attitude of our grandmothers
      towards the male sex. It lingers still in old-fashioned, sequestered
      places.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was late when Sylvester's cab stopped at his house in Weymouth Street.
      He attempted to open the door with his latch-key, but the chain was up,
      and he had to ring and wait in the drizzling rain until a shivering and
      tousled servant came down. At another time he would have felt a chill of
      desolation at entering the dark and fireless house, so cold in its
      unwelcome. But to-night he was strung to a high pitch; and the loneliness
      of his surroundings failed to touch the usually responsive chord. He went
      upstairs to his room, dominated by a fixed idea. He would stop the
      marriage, thus tardily doing his father's bidding, and have Roderick
      arrested on a charge of forgery. If his father died, his murder would
      thus, at least, be avenged.
    </p>
    <p>
      Early the next morning he went to Roderick's chambers. The servant, who
      was setting the breakfast table, informed him that Mr. Usher had not yet
      been called.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wake him and say that Dr. Lanyon particularly wishes to see him,&rdquo; said
      Sylvester.
    </p>
    <p>
      The servant retired and returned a few moments afterwards with a request
      that he would wait for Mr. Usher in the studio. She conducted him thither
      and having put a match to the fire, departed. The room was bare, the
      hangings taken down, the knick-knacks packed in cases lying untidily about
      the floor, the pictures stacked against the walls,&mdash;all in
      preparation for the coming change in Roderick's way of living.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently a door opened, and Roderick appeared in dressing-gown and
      slippers. His cheeks were sunken, his eyes bloodshot. He looked like a man
      hag-ridden. He drew a quick, short breath at the first sight of
      Sylvester's threatening face. All his jauntiness had gone. He went a step
      or two towards his visitor and said curtly,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have forged my father's name to a cheque for £3,000,&rdquo; said Sylvester.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can I see it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sylvester drew the cheque from his pocketbook and held it up for the
      other's inspection.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I perceive the bankers have honoured it,&rdquo; said Roderick. &ldquo;Mr. Lanyon will
      not repudiate it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will not have the chance. <i>I</i> repudiate it. He is lying
      unconscious,&mdash;perhaps at the point of death. By God! if he dies you
      will have killed him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are talking rank folly,&rdquo; said Roderick, leaning against the jamb of
      the window, his hands in his dressing-gown pockets. &ldquo;Mr. Lanyon as my
      solicitor sold out certain of my investments and sent me a cheque for the
      total amount.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A cheque to which there is no counterfoil, taken from a cheque-book in
      use three years ago?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sylvester laughed harshly and buttoned his overcoat, which he had opened
      so as to get at the cheque. Roderick grew white and passed his hand across
      his forehead. There was a moment's silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As a matter of elementary justice,&rdquo; said Sylvester, &ldquo;I came here first
      for your explanation. As you can give none, I will now put the matter in
      the hands of the police, and in an hour or two there will be a warrant out
      for your arrest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He moved towards the door. Roderick staggered away from the window and
      drew his hand hard across his face in a gesture of utter weariness. The
      strain of the past week had been too much. Always thriftless and reckless
      in money matters, he had hitherto stopped short of unredeemed rascality.
      The burden of a crime had crushed his self-assurance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop a moment,&rdquo; he said hoarsely. &ldquo;There are other considerations.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have them in view,&rdquo; replied Sylvester, icily. He turned again. Roderick
      hurriedly interposed himself between him and the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For God's sake, man, think of what you are doing! I don't deny it. There!
      I can't. It is more than I can bear. I have been in hell for the past
      week, devoured alive, with the flames licking my soul. I was driven to it,
      to save myself from disgrace. I was desperate. I would have replaced the
      money. By Heaven! I would. It was my only chance to avert sudden crash and
      to marry the woman I love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You love!&rdquo; sneered Sylvester.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, the woman I love and crave and worship, for whose sake I'd commit a
      thousand crimes. I was pushed hard, I tell you, with my back against the
      wall. I had to. Go back to Ayresford and tell your father I'll repay it,&mdash;every
      penny. I swear to God I will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With Miss Defries's money. Rob Peter to pay Paul. Let me pass.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are going to have me arrested?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;Sylvester&mdash;good God!&rdquo; cried Roderick, in incoherent
      agony. &ldquo;Think of what it means&mdash;our old friendship&mdash;we were
      young together&mdash;we have grown old together&mdash;years ago, when you
      too were marrying a sweet woman, I stood by your side&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your damned hand has been in every tragedy of my life,&rdquo; exclaimed
      Sylvester, kindled into a sudden flame of anger. &ldquo;And a damned woman's! If
      it had not been for a woman, you would not have killed my father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the midst of his frantic anxiety, it was suddenly revealed to Roderick
      that in alluding to Sylvester's marriage he had touched the man's hidden
      wound. He hastened to repair his blunder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not pleading for myself alone,&rdquo; he said, drawing himself up and
      speaking in a more dignified voice. &ldquo;You can disgrace me, but my disgrace
      will fall on another&mdash;whom your father loves. If you arrest me, the
      marriage will be broken off by a miserable, horrible scandal,&mdash;one
      that will poison a woman's whole existence. It would be more than pain to
      your father if such hurt happened to Ella Defries.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You certainly don't propose that I should let this marriage take place
      to-morrow?&rdquo; said Sylvester, recovering his cold scorn of manner. But he
      was somewhat checked in his purpose by Roderick's argument, and Roderick
      saw that he had gained a point.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I happen to know,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that you would be carrying out your father's
      wish in preventing my marriage. I undertake to break it off. The day I
      marry her you can arrest me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again Sylvester laughed harshly. &ldquo;You know very well you would be safe
      then, as Ella Defries's husband.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned and walked to the window and looked out in deep thought. He
      hated the man, clung fiercely to the revengeful joy of seeing him stamped
      out of decent existence. Compromise was wormwood, and yet compromise there
      must be. Roderick remained by the door straining haggard eyes at his
      judge, a strange figure, with his gorgeous dressing-gown and dishevelled
      hair, in the midst of the dismantled and rubbish-strewn room. Sylvester's
      last words had sent the thrill of a forlorn hope through his veins and he
      waited with throbbing heart for the other to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last Sylvester faced him again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will give you a day's grace,&rdquo; he said stonily. &ldquo;You will leave
      Liverpool Street tonight at 8.30 for the Hook of Holland; one way of
      getting to the Continent is as good as another, and I happen to choose
      this one. You can take what steps you like to inform Miss Defries that you
      cannot marry her tomorrow or any other time. Those are my terms. I shall
      have a warrant ready. If you shuffle out of them, I shall put it in force
      and proceed against you without mercy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mercilessness is a dangerous game when a creature is driven to bay,&rdquo; said
      Roderick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What could you do?&rdquo; asked Sylvester, contemptuously.
    </p>
    <p>
      Roderick drew his shoulders together and turned away. &ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; he said
      in a low voice. &ldquo;No, damn it! nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Somehow he could not utter the threat that rose to his lips. His soul
      revolted. It is one of the strangest facts in human psychology that there
      is no man so vile but that there is one thing he cannot and will not do:
      sometimes the thing is a hideous crime, sometimes only a comparatively
      trivial act of dishonour; but whatever may be its relative importance,
      there is always one virtuous principle to which the human soul must cling.
      Roderick had blackmailed the father,&mdash;for that is what his forgery
      came to,&mdash;but he could not blackmail the son. Nor could he drag his
      own father, hoary scoundrel though he knew him to be, down with him in his
      disgrace. So he kept silent as to the mysterious relations between the two
      old men, and&mdash;unutterable pathos of poor humanity&mdash;his silence
      was a salve to his conscience.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sylvester turned the handle of the studio door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you accept my terms?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Roderick, suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good,&rdquo; said Sylvester, and he closed the door behind him and went
      downstairs into the street. There he took a cab and drove to Scotland
      Yard.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was not the man to utter idle threats. Before dictating conditions to
      Roderick, he had coldly calculated upon the power that he could wield.
      Like that of every London specialist, his practice was socially varied to
      a curious extent. Among his patients was a high official at Scotland Yard,
      who, he knew, without dereliction of duty, would courteously carry out the
      arrangements he intended to suggest. The official received him as he had
      anticipated. In order to avoid a painful scandal in society, it would be
      better to let the culprit fly the country. Of course there would be no
      talk of extradition. In the mean time, a warrant could be issued and put
      in force whenever Dr. Lanyon gave the word. Sylvester went home grimly
      satisfied with his morning's work. He found awaiting him a telegram from
      Simmons to the effect that his father's condition was unchanged.
    </p>
    <p>
      Roderick went into his dining-room, as dismantled and cheerless as the
      studio, and drank a cup of coffee. He tried to eat, but the food choked
      him. He was crushed, beaten, ruined. Utter dejection was in his attitude
      as he sat in the straight-backed chair, staring helplessly in front of
      him. Even in his crimes he had failed. He had deferred paying in the
      forged cheque to the very last moment possible for the cheque he had
      written for Urquhart to be honoured by his own bankers. He had reckoned on
      clearing-house delay, on the half-day of Saturday, on the intervening <i>dies
      non</i> of Sunday, in fact, on the cheque not coming under Matthew's
      notice until after the wedding. But the cheque had passed from bank to
      bank with diabolical expedition, and, like the curses in the Spanish
      proverb, it had come home to roost with a vengeance.
    </p>
    <p>
      What was to become of him? He could scarcely realise his sentence. Exile
      from England meant a bitter struggle with poverty; and yet exile was his
      irremediable lot. In eight or nine hours he must start. There was no
      escape. He knew Sylvester of old, as hard as iron and as cold as ice, a
      man to carry out his purpose relentlessly. To-night&mdash;to leave this
      dear world of London behind him; tomorrow&mdash;to be in the aimless
      solitude of some foreign hotel, when, if fortune had been kind, he would
      have been standing at the altar with the woman whom he desired above all
      women that had ever entered his life. It was like the blank future of the
      man condemned to death.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thoughts of his own misdoing, of his banishment, faded into a vague
      heaviness at the back of his brain, while the pang of a great hunger
      gripped him. He flung his arms on the table and buried his head and
      clutched his hair in both hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My God, my God! I can't give her up!&rdquo; he cried. Now that she was torn
      from him, he craved her with the awful passion of the man no longer young.
      A picture of her ripe lips and her fresh, eager face, so quick to flush,
      floated maddeningly before his closed eyes. Last night on parting he had
      held her close and kissed her. He felt the yielding softness of her bosom
      against his breast, could almost feel now the throb of her heart. He bit
      through his sleeve into his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      The paroxysm passed. He must think. The wedding must be postponed.
      Sylvester had intrusted him with that duty, out of regard for Ella. See
      her he could not; his soul shrank from it. A cowardly letter to reach her
      too late for questions to be asked, giving no reasons, simply stating that
      he was summoned away that night for an indefinite period? It must be
      written. He grovelled in his self-abasement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly he raised his head and stared up, with panting breath and
      trembling body. A wild, mad idea had sprung from a recrudescence of the
      forlorn hope with which Sylvester's words had inspired him. He sprang to
      his feet with a quavering, hysterical laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Christ! I'll carry it through,&rdquo; he cried, and he walked about the
      room, swinging his arms in great gestures.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVII&mdash;A WEDDING EVE
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he room was in a
      state of bewitching confusion. Trunks, half filled, yawned open on the
      floor. On the bed were piles of white garments in the midst of which here
      and there a pink or blue ribbon peeped daintily. Cardboard boxes and
      tissue paper pervaded space. Hats small and hats immense lay about in
      unconsidered attitudes upon chintz-covered chairs and other
      resting-places. A pearl-coloured ball-dress, all gauze and chiffon and
      foamy nothingness, hung over the bed-rail. A thousand odds and ends&mdash;veils,
      hatpins, mysterious smooth wooden boxes, and cut-glass phials&mdash;were
      strewn on the tables. And the pale morning sunshine streamed in a friendly
      way into the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ella was superintending her packing. Her maid having gone out for a
      moment, she sat on the edge of the bed (leaving, with feminine sureness of
      pose, the dainty piles of garments aforesaid unscathed), and gazed
      critically at a hat which she held on outstretched fingers thrust into the
      crown. In a dark silk blouse and a plain skirt, and with her auburn hair
      somewhat ruffled, she looked very simple and girlish. Lady Milmo,
      occupying the only vacant chair opposite, also regarded the hat with the
      eye of experience. The examination had, however, come to an end, for Ella,
      after flicking the great bows with the finger-tips of her disengaged hand,
      threw the confection lightly on the top of the pile, and putting her hands
      in her lap resignedly, turned to her aunt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure Josephine will disappoint me with the blue dress.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, my dear,&rdquo; said Lady Milmo, &ldquo;kingdoms may fall and empires may
      decay, but Josephine never fails. A woman of her word, my dear. Don't you
      know what she did for La Guira, the singer? La Guira ordered four dresses
      to take away with her to Patagonia or somewhere. It was impossible to
      finish them before the morning of departure. Josephine herself raced with
      them to Waterloo in a hansom just in time to see the train with La Guira
      in it steam out of the station; and that woman took a special there and
      then, and chased the train and got the dresses on board all right.
      Josephine is a marvellous woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ella laughed. She did not care very much. Her life at that moment was too
      full.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's quite sweet of the sun to come in and see me, isn't it?&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Provided he keeps up his good behaviour to-morrow,&rdquo; said Lady Milmo.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I sha'n't mind what he does tomorrow; I shall have too many things to
      think of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what about us poor unfortunates who are not going to be married?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You could be married now, fifty times over, auntie, if you chose,&rdquo; said
      Ella, out of her lightness of heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Lord preserve me!&rdquo; replied Lady Milmo, vivaciously. &ldquo;When poor
      Howgate died I vowed that when we met in heaven, if there is one, no other
      man should stand between us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As the late Sir Howgate Milmo, Bart., had been a notoriously evil liver,
      Ella did not think there was much chance of her aunt escaping forsworn,
      even on her hypothesis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One can love heaps of times, you know,&rdquo; she said, stretching out her
      limbs girlishly and looking at the tips of her shoes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Love your husband once and for all, my dear,&rdquo; said her aunt,
      sententiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ella rose to her feet and crossed over to her aunt's chair and sat on the
      arm, and kissed Lady Milmo. A spontaneous caress like that was rare with
      her, and the recipient looked up in pleased surprise. But Ella had grasped
      her fate in both hands and felt mistress thereof, and all seemed right
      with the world. She had compelled herself into entire happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I do&mdash;or I shall,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;Do you think I could
      marry a man to whom I did not feel I could give all that is in me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the fate of women to give,&rdquo; said Lady Milmo, who was in a
      moralising mood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must do something to justify our existence,&rdquo; laughed Ella. &ldquo;Women
      can't do much. I used to think differently when I was young. Men do all
      the real work in the world, but somehow they seem to want something from
      women. And it's a great thing to help on the big world by giving oneself
      body and soul to a man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cook his food and wash his clothes and see that there is a proper supply
      of Salutaris water when he comes home after a city dinner That was the
      whole duty of woman in your grandmother's time, child.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think women are very much the same all through the ages,&rdquo; said Ella.
      &ldquo;At least,&rdquo; she added reflectively, &ldquo;that's the only way the riddle seems
      to be solved. A man does, wants, compels. A woman yields&mdash;otherwise&mdash;why,
      well&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She rose, confused at' her half-confession, and re-examined the hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Otherwise why should I be wanting to meet poor dear Howgate in heaven,&rdquo;
       finished Lady Milmo, coming to her assistance with a humorous curl of the
      lip. &ldquo;Anyhow,&rdquo; she continued with some irrelevance, &ldquo;I'm glad you're going
      to stay in a decent Christian country, where you can wear your pretty
      frocks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So am I, auntie&mdash;now,&rdquo; replied Ella. &ldquo;But I didn't think I should
      be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ella's maid came in, and the work of packing was resumed. Her mistress
      tried on the much-considered hat before the pier-glass, while Lady Milmo
      arranged the rumpled hair beneath, so that the hat should produce its due
      effect. Then one of the bridesmaids came, ostensibly to see if she could
      help; really to feast her innocent eyes upon the articles of attire
      everywhere displayed. The time slipped by pleasantly. At twelve o'clock
      the parlour-maid tapped at the door and entered with the announcement that
      Mr. Usher was downstairs and desired to see Miss Ella on most urgent
      business.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Milmo threw up her hands. What could he want? Men were a positive
      nuisance at weddings! They ought to be chained up for days before and only
      let loose at the church door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm in such a mess,&rdquo; cried Ella. But she sent down a message to Roderick
      that she would see him directly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The servant smiled and departed. Ella gave herself those anxious feminine
      tidying touches before her glass, whose effect the eternal irony decrees
      shall never be noticed by man, and ran happily down the stairs to meet her
      lover. She turned the handle of the morning-room door and stood before
      him, in the heyday of her youth and her charm. All the anxieties of the
      past year had fallen from her. Her cheeks flushed a shy welcome. Her eyes,
      honest and clear, smiled upon him. She moved quickly forward, her lips
      already parted in happy speech, when suddenly she felt him come upon her
      and encircle her with strong, resistless arms and rain passionate kisses
      upon her mouth and cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my God, I love you, I love you!&rdquo; he murmured hoarsely. &ldquo;I can't let
      you go. You are soul of my soul and blood of my blood. No, Ella, no,&rdquo; he
      continued, as, confused and blushing, she strove to release herself; &ldquo;I
      must keep you here. Heaven knows when I may hold you in my arms again.
      Listen, something terrible has happened,&mdash;a thing that may part our
      lives. Are you strong enough to bear it? Brave and strong and heroic, like
      the woman I think you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He relaxed his clasp and stood with hands on her shoulders, forcing her to
      look at him. She met his passion-filled eyes fearlessly, but her colour
      had gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Part our lives! I don't understand what you mean, Roderick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you brave enough to face a terrible calamity?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall not faint, if you mean that,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must leave England to-night,&rdquo; he said in a quick voice. &ldquo;How long I
      shall have to stay away, I do not know. It may be weeks, it may be months,
      it may be years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him with perplexed brows and a dawning fear in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But to-morrow&mdash;&rdquo; she began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There will be no to-morrow&mdash;for me. Unless&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unless what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned away and paced across the room and back again. He had thrown off
      the gold pince-nez, and now they swung by the cord over his waistcoat, and
      his small blue eyes, usually obscured by them, glowed strangely and the
      pupils were dilated. Where the actor, the inveterate <i>poseur</i>, ended
      and the man began, it were impossible to tell. He was playing a part, but
      playing it in desperate earnestness. The words, the gestures, were false;
      but the yearning folly of love that vibrated in his voice was as real a
      thing as had ever entered into the man's life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must be plain with you, Ella. It's as much as my life, my honour, your
      fair happiness, is worth for me to stay in England over to-night. There
      can be no wedding to-morrow. I have done all that a man could do to avert
      things. The suspense has been a torturing agony above words. But the
      inevitable, the inexorable, has come. Oh, God, Ella, if you knew what
      living hell it is to me to tell you this!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She put her hands before her face, feeling dazed and sick, and when she
      drew them away, her face was very white. Like every pure woman, her
      thoughts of late had been absorbed by the sweet vanities of the morrow's
      ceremony, with just a warm, tremulous sub-consciousness of the beyond. The
      sudden fall about her ears of this structure of vanities bewildered her.
      Her brain seemed to be an avalanche of telegrams and letters. Faces of
      bidden guests swam lurid before her. Roderick, a long way off, faded into
      infinite mist. A pang of disappointment, humiliation, she knew not what,
      ached in her breast. She scarcely heard or heeded what the man was saying.
      He stopped, seeing her so white, and looked at her, breathless. Then
      suddenly a cloud seemed to roll away before her, and she was conscious of
      him standing there with haggard eyes and features drawn in pain. Scorn of
      her first imaginings drove them into the limbo of all vain things; the
      thrill of a proud courage nerved her; she drew herself up and faced
      realities. And the first reality was a rush through her being of yearning
      pity for the man so stricken. With an impulse of consolation she went up
      to him, and again his arms closed swiftly round her. He murmured burning
      incoherences. He could not live without her love, the crown and joy of
      earthly things. Life would be a purgatorial flame. He loved her. He
      worshipped her, so brave, so loyal, so adorable. His voice was vibrant
      with elemental passion.
    </p>
    <p>
      A woman, young and ardent, with rich blood running through her veins, is,
      above all things, a primitive human being. It were an ill day for the
      pride and vigour of the race if she were not. There are moments when the
      world's music surges like the roar of the sea in her ears, and the heart
      within her is lifted to her lips; when her limbs are as water, and her
      body is carried in the unfaltering arms of a god through illimitable
      space. She has yielded, is swept away by the man's passion, deliriously
      lost.
    </p>
    <p>
      As in a dream, standing there in his embrace, she heard him whisper:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is one way&mdash;to scoff at destiny&mdash;to rise triumphant above
      it&mdash;to be married tomorrow in spite of all things. Not here. In
      Holland where I am summoned&mdash;I have the license&mdash;we can explain
      the urgency of our flight&mdash;the English Consul or Chaplain at
      Amsterdam will marry us. Come with me tonight&mdash;Ella&mdash;for God's
      sake, Ella, say that you will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She smiled up at him without replying. The mad proposal seemed at the
      dreamy moment the sweetest of sanities. He continued in hurried intensity,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All will be so easy. You can say you are going to Ayresford&mdash;what
      more natural?&mdash;to stay here would be pain&mdash;there is a train for
      Ayresford about the time&mdash;half-past eight at Liverpool Street. I will
      meet you there with a ticket,&mdash;and then we shall be carried off to
      happiness&mdash;you and I&mdash;alone together&mdash;to conquer the
      world.... There&mdash;it must be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took her hands, kissed them both, and released her. She stood for a
      while with downcast eyes and heaving bosom, recovering her mental balance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have not yet told me,&rdquo; she said presently, in a calmer voice, &ldquo;why
      there should be this upheaval. I have said perhaps I might help you. Why
      do your life and honour and my happiness depend upon your leaving England
      to-night, Roderick?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The supreme moment had come. He braced every nerve to meet the inevitable
      question. Summoning up an extraordinary dignity subtly tinged with
      sadness, he said with grave deliberation,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ella recoiled involuntarily, staggered by the unexpectedness of the reply.
      She could only regard him in mute but anxious questioning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must trust me, child,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It is another's secret.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So grave as to be withheld even from me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Even so,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; he continued gravely, &ldquo;I am asking you
      the ultimate thing a man can ask a woman,&mdash;blind trust. It is a thing
      that only the great soul, like you, can give. Put your hand in mine and
      trust in me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me think,&rdquo; she said in a low voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      She sat down on a couch, baffled. If she looked up, she met the man's
      burning eyes fixed upon her, and the depths of her being were stirred. If
      she looked away, her life seemed fragmentary chaos, unrealisable,
      incomprehensible. She breathed fast from a heaving bosom. Roderick's
      mystery hovered between the grotesque and the tragic. To run away
      clandestinely with the man to whom she was to have been married with all
      the pomp of publicity on the morrow was an idea of comic opera. On the
      other hand, the blind trust required raised the proceeding to the heroic
      plane. Again, Nature within her shrank from mystery; she was a child
      appalled by the dark, and fear was upon her. But the sensitive gentlewoman
      felt the appeal to honour in every fibre of her pride. Generosity swelled
      against doubt. A strange physical coldness enwrapped her. To start
      to-night, with Roderick, surrendering herself utterly; the maiden in her
      piteously sought refuge from the thought. She glanced tremulously up at
      him, and her face flamed pink, and warmth entered her heart. She covered
      her cheeks with her hands and shrank into the corner of the couch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, could I not join you afterwards?&rdquo; she moaned. He fell at her feet and
      clasped her knees, broke into impassioned pleading. It was a matter of
      life or death. His unbalanced artistic temperament burst all restraints of
      conventional forms of speech. He raved of his consuming need. He was less
      a man than a shaking passion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The eternal mystery to woman is man's desire of her. It transcends her
      thought, it looms immense, inscrutable, and irresistible before her. She
      is the everlasting Semele beneath the fiery glory of Zeus. It is decreed
      that when brought face to face with it (a chord within her being
      responsive, be it understood), she shall lose all sense of the proportion
      between it and the infinite passions of the universe. Life resolves itself
      into an amazement that she, with a whisper, a touch of her hand, can raise
      a man from hell to heaven. In the piteous, glorious, tragi-comedy of life,
      which has been played on millions of stages for millions of years, this
      elemental fact is so commonplace that it escapes our notice. We are apt to
      judge from externals, from the results of adherence to ethical systems,
      from social conventions; and when the actions of men and women are not
      provided for in artificial canons, we are baffled or are shocked by a
      sense of the immoral, the abnormal, or the preposterous. But men will
      desire and women will yield till the end of the human race.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Ella yielded. She bound herself to meet him that evening and go with
      him into the darkness, whithersoever he should lead; and Roderick left the
      house, holding his head high, exultant in the sense of having conquered
      destiny.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when he had gone, Ella threw herself face downwards on the couch in
      all the abandonment of exhaustion. For a while she could not think; she
      could only be conscious of the flow and ebb, and again the flow and ebb,
      and once more the flow of emotion, during the past hour. She had entered
      the room in light-hearted happiness; there had come the shock of an awful
      dismay. Then she had been lifted in the tide of the man's passion; there
      had followed the cold numbness of doubt; again passion had swept away
      reason. Now was reaction. She felt physically prostrated, and her body
      ached as if it had been beaten. Her eyelids burned. She would have liked
      to cry miserably, but she could not. She suffered the woman's torment of
      unshed tears. Suddenly she rose and drew herself together, despising her
      weakness. She had pledged herself to do a certain thing. It was to be
      done, and practical commonplaces had to be faced. First was the breaking
      of the news to Lady Milmo. The girl's heart was smitten with pity for the
      kindly lady who had entered so wholeheartedly into these wedding
      preparations. It would be a keen disappointment to countermand the feast,
      put off the guests, make lame excuses. And that would not be the end.
      There would be the scandal of her flight, of which Lady Milmo would have
      to bear the brunt. It was cruel to treat her so. She went to the window
      and looked out at the sunny houses on the other side of Pont Street;
      wondered whether they all were cages for women bound as she was in
      invisible chains. Her course had been marked out with scrupulous
      exactness; to deviate from it a hair's breadth would be not only breaking
      a solemn pledge, but perhaps endangering the life or honour, she knew not
      how, of the man she was to marry. Yet her frank soul rebelled against the
      deception. The hour of Roderick's departure was to be kept secret; her
      elopement with him not to be whispered of. She was to give out a journey
      to Ayresford, to escape from the painful associations of the house in Pont
      Street, filled with all the vain preparations for the morrow. She had
      never lied barefacedly in her life, and for a moment she hated Roderick
      for compelling her to falseness. But then the lingering echoes of his
      voice hummed in her ears, and the blood rushed back into her cheeks, and
      she felt strong for the sacrifice of her honour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Did she love him? She answered the self-put question with a passionate
      affirmative. Else why was she doing this preposterous thing? Was not the
      blindness of her trust the very banner of her love? A phrase of Roderick's
      crossed her mind. &ldquo;Life is merely the summation of moments of keen
      living.&rdquo; She caught at it as a plank with the drowning man's thrill. She
      was living keenly; that alone was sufficient to justify everything. She
      was defying the set uses of the tame world. &ldquo;Each man must batter down for
      himself the doors that hide life's inner glory&rdquo; was another of his
      sayings. Was she not even now battering at the door? Her soul clutched at
      every supporting straw. Yet, in spite of these aphoristic comforts, it was
      with a strange, dull sense of fatality that she saw herself sitting by
      Roderick's side in the train that night, being carried away further and
      further into the inscrutable darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The first part of her task was over. She had told Lady Milmo. It had been
      an interview of pain and self-reproach. Lady Milmo had gasped, wept, waxed
      indignant. All her kindly woman's motherliness had poured itself out upon
      the girl, whom she considered infamously treated. It was in vain for Ella
      to plead the matter of life and death that called Roderick away. Lady
      Milmo had her prejudices. She had cordially approved of Ella's immediate
      retirement to Ayresford. How could the poor child stay in the house where
      every surrounding would be a pain to her? She had sent Ella off to lie
      down in peace upon her own bed, away from the half-packed litter of finery
      in the girl's room; and while Ella lay there with a splitting headache,
      helplessly counting the slow hours, Lady Milmo sat heroically before her
      writing-table immersed in lists and telegraph forms.
    </p>
    <p>
      The slow hours passed. A little difficulty arose. Lady Milmo had taken it
      for granted that Ella's maid would accompany her to Ayresford. Ella,
      alarmed, announced her intention of leaving her behind. She did not even
      wish her to come to the station to see after the luggage. She had to
      insist that solitude was essential. Lady Milmo yielded the point
      reluctantly. At last the time came. Ella's luggage had been placed on the
      fourwheeled cab. The door was open; the white-capped maid stood on the
      pavement. Ella turned with a sudden rush of emotion and kissed Lady Milmo,
      who had come with her to the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I ever hurt you, dear, God knows it's because I cannot help it,&rdquo; she
      said. But before the other could reply, a telegraph boy entered with a
      telegram. Name of Defries. Ella tore it open, with a spasm of
      anticipation, half fear, half hope, that it came from Roderick. But it
      ran:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;<i>Your coming a joy. Your uncle dangerously ill. Is crying
     for you. Agatha.</i>&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Speechless she handed the paper to her aunt. Lady Milmo glanced at it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doesn't it all work out for the best, dear?&rdquo; she said gently. &ldquo;Agatha
      Lanyon would not have wired if to-morrow's affair had not been broken
      off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did she know?&rdquo; asked Ella, with white lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I sent them a message,&rdquo; said Lady Milmo.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ella bade her good-bye again. The parlour maid shut the cab-door and gave
      the word &ldquo;Waterloo&rdquo; to the driver. The cab drove off, and then Ella,
      spreading out the crumpled telegram, broke for the first time into a flood
      of passionate tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      But some moments later she called to the driver,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fancy the servant made a mistake. It is Liverpool Street I want to go
      to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And to Liverpool Street was she driven.

      CHAPTER XVIII&mdash;FELLOW-TRAVELLERS
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span> misty evening had
      followed the sunshine of the day. The lights in Liverpool Street, in
      shop-windows, street-lamps, and the lamps of a thousand crossing and
      recrossing vehicles, flared red and large through the slight fog.
      Luggage-laden cabs clattered down the flagged incline of the station,
      sounding a hard treble to the thundering bass of the street and city
      above. Down the sides of the incline streamed the throng of work people
      and belated clerks hurrying to their trains. The station portico beyond
      seemed a dark vortex into which this seething life was sucked with
      irresistible swiftness. There, in the uncertain light, was the bustle of
      porters unloading cabs, the quick rattle of trucks and barrows, the
      ceaseless patter of feet, the din of voices. It was an eddying whirl of
      vague shapes appearing for a moment from the fog and vanishing after a
      flash of passage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Roderick stood by the wall, gazing anxiously at each cab as it stopped and
      deposited its fare. He had taken the two tickets, registered his luggage
      through to Amsterdam, and now was waiting in feverish suspense for Ella.
      Would she come? He looked at his watch. It was only five minutes past
      eight, and he had been watching for her since the quarter to the hour. He
      threw away a cigarette barely commenced, and a moment afterwards lit
      another. By the light of the match his fingers could have been seen to
      shake nervously. At last a cab stopped, a porter opened the door, and
      Roderick's heart gave a leap of relief and joy as he saw the familiar
      girlish figure emerge. He sprang to her side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, thank God you have come, dear, thank God!&rdquo; he whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I keep my word,&rdquo; said Ella, remotely. Roderick gave some directions to
      the porters, and turned to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will show you straight into our carriage. I have reserved one for
      ourselves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He led the way through the booking offices to the great glass-covered
      station, with its blue glare of electric light and babel of sounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My heroic Ella,&rdquo; he murmured. She raised her eyes somewhat appealingly.
      Then he saw she had been crying; her lashes were still wet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Those tears are the last you shall ever shed,&rdquo; he whispered, bending down
      to her ear. In reply she held out the crumpled ball of paper which she had
      kept in her hand. He stood by the platform gate and read, and looking at
      the telegram, reflected. The instinct of the self-indulgent man prompted a
      reply. A dry-eyed woman, be she never so beloved, was a pleasanter
      travelling companion than a tearful one. He handed her back the telegram
      with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's the dear elderly lady's exaggeration. Mr. Lanyon is kept to his room
      by a slight cold. That is all. I saw Sylvester this afternoon, and he had
      only left Ayresford this morning. Make yourself quite easy, dearest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She followed him through the gate, along the platform where the Harwich
      train stood waiting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You take a great weight off my mind,&rdquo; she said earnestly. &ldquo;I have felt it
      was wicked and selfish of me to leave him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My poor child,&rdquo; said Roderick, tenderly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The guard hurried up and unlocked the door of the reserved carriage. The
      porter, who had followed them, stowed Ella's hand-baggage and wraps in the
      rack. Ella entered and took her seat, while Roderick hastened away to see
      to the registration of her heavy luggage. Tears of a great relief filled
      her eyes. However much she hated Sylvester, she knew that he would not
      have spoken lightly to any one of his father's illness; nor would he have
      left his father's bedside if anything serious were the matter with the old
      man. Roderick's confident report reassured her. She felt almost happy. If
      only her head were not aching, and a strange heaviness were lifted off
      her heart!
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently Roderick returned, took the seat opposite, and closed the door.
      His face had lost the haggardness that had troubled her during the past
      week and wore an aspect of conquering pride. He had looked thus in the few
      golden moments when she had cared for him most. His bright air of
      confidence gave her strength. Her pulses quickened a little. He was worthy
      of her blind trust. The instinct of the woman to satisfy herself that the
      plank on which she walks is the solid earth brought swift apotheosis of
      the man. She was humble, little, of no account; he was strong and great,
      with the artist's noble grip upon life. And he loved her passionately. She
      leaned forward, touched his arm, and with the first smile for many hours
      she asked him whether he was content. He vowed his utter happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will never have cause to regret this step to the day of your death,&rdquo;
       he said fervently.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that moment the face of a man appeared at the window, and Roderick
      threw himself back with a stifled exclamation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sylvester!&rdquo; cried Ella, involuntarily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sylvester looked from one to the other in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not expect to see you here, Miss Defries,&rdquo; he said at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ella drew herself up haughtily. &ldquo;I am the sole mistress of my actions,&rdquo;
       she said. &ldquo;What I choose to do is not your concern, Dr. Lanyon.&rdquo; For the
      moment indignation checked natural wonder at his presence. Sylvester
      regarded her sternly. His dark face seemed chiselled out of wood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unfortunately, it is of vital concern to me,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;But I
      apologise a thousand times for interrupting you.&rdquo; He turned to Roderick,
      over whose face a pallor was spreading. &ldquo;A friend of mine would like to
      speak to you for a few moments.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry I am not at his disposal,&rdquo; returned Roderick, with a forced
      laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would hardly care to discuss the matter with him here,&rdquo; said
      Sylvester.
    </p>
    <p>
      Roderick consulted his watch. The spark of hope died out. There were still
      ten minutes before the train would start.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Remember our compact,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;You guaranteed I should be annoyed no
      further. This is a breach of faith.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ella leaned before the window, obscuring Roderick from the other's view.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How dare you intrude in this unwarrantable manner?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Defries,&rdquo; said Sylvester, coldly, &ldquo;please do not interfere in the
      very grave affairs of men.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She sank back in her corner, cut to the quick by the rebuke, and quivering
      with baffled indignation. Sylvester again addressed Roderick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your presence here with Miss Defries is a breach of faith, and renders
      our compact void. Once more, for Miss Defries's sake, I beg that you will
      come on to the platform and discuss the matter with my friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He opened the door. Roderick got out of the carriage and went a few paces
      along the platform with Sylvester. A decently dressed man took off his hat
      as they approached him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is a police officer,&rdquo; said Sylvester, quietly. &ldquo;He has a warrant for
      your arrest. You were wrong in thinking me such a fool as to trust you. My
      object in coming here was to make certain that you had left by this train.
      If you had not, the police would have been on your track immediately. If
      you had been leaving alone, I should have told the officer you were not
      here, and you would have gone scot free, and the matter would have been
      hushed up. As it is, you have played me false, prevailed by some devilish
      lie upon Miss Defries to elope with you; and, by God! I'll have no pity on
      you. Mr. Wigram, this is the gentleman I was speaking of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The police officer, on being summoned, drew near, and again touching his
      hat stated his errand with due formality and explained that he had no wish
      to create any unpleasantness in a public place, and that if Mr. Usher
      would walk quietly by his side to the cab rank, they could drive away
      unnoticed. A little knot of people saying farewell to friends by an open
      carriage door, and one or two hurrying passengers, eyed Roderick's ghastly
      face with some curiosity. The guard of the train bustled up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, sir, perhaps you had better take your seat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am prevented, at the last moment, from travelling with you,&rdquo; said
      Roderick, with bitter cynicism.
    </p>
    <p>
      The guard saluted and passed on. Roderick's eyes followed him and rested
      on Ella looking anxiously from the carriage window. He turned away with a
      sob.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come on, if I must go,&rdquo; he said hoarsely; &ldquo;you will pay for this
      outrageous blunder, Dr. Lanyon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He walked away defiantly with the police officer, and Sylvester went up to
      Ella. The guard was just fitting the key in the door to lock it. Sylvester
      laid a detaining touch upon his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The lady is getting out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The door was thrown open. Sylvester took Ella's travelling-bag from the
      rack.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your companion is not going abroad this evening,&rdquo; said he, pausing with
      the bag on the seat. &ldquo;And it will be scarcely worth your while to go to
      Amsterdam alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl's white, questioning face made him relent for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive me,&rdquo; he said more kindly. &ldquo;But what has happened was inevitable.
      I have only saved you from the hands of a scoundrel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How dare you call him that?&rdquo; she whispered with trembling lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not reply, but handed the bag and wraps to a porter whom he
      summoned, and descending from the carriage stood in readiness to assist
      Ella to the platform. She obeyed his sign involuntarily, but as soon as
      she stood opposite him, she turned upon him with flashing anger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now tell me at once what all this means,&rdquo; she said in a low, concentrated
      tone. &ldquo;I am not a child to have things hidden from me. I have lived too
      many hours to-day in darkness. What does it mean? Why are you here, coming
      between me and the man I am to marry? Where has Roderick gone? Tell me. I
      must know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like to spare you the knowledge,&mdash;at all events, for the
      present.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He made a motion of his hand to indicate the public place. His glance fell
      upon the porter standing expectant with the bag. Giving the man a
      shilling, he bade him take the things to a cab and await him there. Then
      he turned to Ella.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps we might find a more suitable place.&rdquo; he added. But Ella stamped
      her foot impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Here, at once! What is this mystery? Where has Roderick gone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The guard's whistle blew, the engine shrieked, there was a flutter back of
      loungers from the carriage doors, and the train steamed out of the
      station, carrying neither Roderick nor his fortunes, carrying only, with
      the grotesque irony that accompanies most of the tragic issues of life,
      the registered luggage of Ella and himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sylvester waited until the commotion had subsided. Then he spoke in his
      cold, unemotional way,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has been arrested by the police for forgery, at my instance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl's eye closed for a few tremulous seconds, and reeling she put her
      hand to her heart; but she waved Sylvester away when he came forward to
      prevent her from falling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not going to faint&mdash;I said so before today&mdash;it is a
      hideous lie&mdash;he is shielding some one else&mdash;he told me it was
      another's secret. It is some horrible revenge of yours&mdash;you always
      hated him. An honorable gentleman to do such a thing&mdash;it is
      ridiculous, inconceivable! It is you that have trapped him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The lowered tones in which the girl spoke contrasted strangely with the
      shrieking hubbub of the glaring station. Through her veil he could see her
      features distorted with anger. He waited until she had ended her
      invective.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He forged my father's name to a cheque for three thousand pounds,&rdquo; he
      said with cutting distinctness. &ldquo;The shock of discovery yesterday has
      brought my father to the point of death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ella swung her head contemptuously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You told Roderick yourself to-day that Uncle Matthew had only a slight
      cold.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The lying devil!&rdquo; cried Sylvester, with one of his rare blazes of anger.
      &ldquo;Read that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He drew a telegram from his pocket, and handed it to her.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;<i>Mr. Lanyons condition critical. May not live through
     night. For God's sake come back at once and bring Miss
     Defries with you. Simmons</i>
</pre>
    <p>
      She returned it without a word, and stood with both hands pressed closely
      to her temples, in an awful convulsion of soul. Roderick's lie blazed
      before her eyes in letters of fire. It was blazoned upon the walls of the
      station. It reddened the pale glare of the electric light. It was a
      magnesium flame illuminating the innermost darkness of the man's heart.
      Roderick's mystery was a mystery no longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us go,&rdquo; she said at last faintly.
    </p>
    <p>
      They walked silently, side by side, to the end of the platform. There was
      the same eternal scurrying of eager feet. A train had just arrived at
      another platform, and the crowd of passengers were streaming through the
      gate on to the open space. Nothing in the outer world had changed during
      the past hour. But Ella was filled with a vague wonder that universal
      chaos did not prevail around her. She followed Sylvester in a state of
      dream, to be aroused to practical effort by his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is your cab. Where would you care to be driven to?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She collected her faculties. Pride rose in arms against betrayal of
      weakness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose there is no train to Ayresford to-night?&rdquo; she asked steadily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. The ten o'clock. A fast train. I am going down by it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would have no objection to my accompanying you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That my father needs you is enough for me to entreat you to come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well. I shall drive to Waterloo and wait there until the train
      starts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I in the mean time must do some necessary business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He gave the direction to the driver and the cab drove off. He hailed
      another and was carried rapidly westward.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the time came for taking her seat at Waterloo in the Ayresford train,
      she mechanically followed a porter to an empty first-class carriage and
      sat down in a further corner, broken with trouble. She was only awakened
      to a sense of surroundings by the door being thrown violently open as soon
      as the train began to move, and a man whom she recognised as Sylvester
      leaping into the compartment. He sat for a moment breathless, then moved
      up the seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not mean to intrude on you,&rdquo; he said, when he had recovered; &ldquo;but I
      nearly missed the train, and this was the first carriage to hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked out of the window into the whirling darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It does not matter,&rdquo; she murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing much matters now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sylvester lay back in his corner with an air of utter fatigue, and closed
      his eyes. They travelled thus in silence for a long time. To Ella the
      world seemed to have come to a disgraceful end. The dying state of the old
      man to whom she was hurrying was in keeping with the general finality of
      things. She suffered a horrible humiliation too deep for coherent thought.
      Gradually, however, the sight of Sylvester opposite, cold and stern, acted
      upon her like an irritant. At one moment she was seized with an hysterical
      impulse to scream. She mastered it, fighting with scornful violence.
      Resentment began to burn within her, first dull, then increasing in
      intensity to fierceness. The flame fed a smouldering horror scarcely as
      yet realised. Roderick was in a police cell that night. He would be tried
      on a disgraceful charge. The result would be imprisonment. Clearer and
      clearer grew the significance of the term. As a woman in touch with the
      thinking world, she had interested herself in contemporary social
      problems. Our prison system had been among those in which she had played
      the pretty part of amateur reformer. As the Honorary Secretary of a
      society which had rapidly burned itself out with excessive zeal, she had
      learned many of the hateful facts. For a fortnight the fate of the
      tenderly nurtured gentleman condemned to the unutterable torture of
      imprisonment had been a nightmare. Her aunt had rediscovered a teacher of
      music, once a well-known singer, now voiceless through illness, Yvonne
      Latour, who had married a man called Joyce, a cultivated gentleman who
      deservedly had passed through the wintry sorrows of the gaol, and Yvonne
      had told her what they meant. Her own troubles, the Walden Art Colony, her
      relations with Roderick, had put the subject out of her mind; but now the
      recollection of these things grew more vivid every moment. Her own
      benumbing sense of humiliation was lost in the new shudder. Liar she knew
      Roderick to be; that he was a forger, reason forbade her to doubt. Yet by
      her yielding to his kisses that day, she had given him, as it were, some
      share of her flesh, and her own flesh quivered at the contaminating touch
      of the gaol.
    </p>
    <p>
      The train thundered on. The windows of the carriage were opaque with
      steam. Opposite sat Sylvester like a sphinx, his cap drawn over his eyes,
      so that she could not see whether they were open or shut. Suddenly the
      brake grated and the wheels dragged beneath the carriage, and the train
      stopped with a jerk at a little, vaguely lighted station. Sylvester looked
      up mechanically and found the girl's eyes, deep and dark behind her veil,
      fixed upon him. She felt impelled to speak, yet altered her appeal at the
      instant the prearranged words were about to leave her lips. Instinctively
      she sought to wound him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If Uncle Matthew is dying, how could you leave his side? I thought you at
      least loved him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stared at her for a moment without replying. It seemed incredible that
      any one should not perceive his torture of anxiety. He forgot the iron
      will whereby he had kept it hidden. To sit idly hour after hour, as he had
      done that day, poignantly conscious of every train that might have taken
      him to that one spot on the earth whither every fibre of his being was
      drawn, to disregard the piteous appeals made to him from time to time, to
      come and comfort the dying man whom he loved so passionately, had been an
      effort of almost superhuman strength. The inability of his questioner to
      realise his suffering bewildered him. At that instant of time it was his
      whole existence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A man's duty is above love or death,&rdquo; he said coldly, after a pause. &ldquo;I
      can't discuss it with you, for you would not understand. At least, I have
      served him in delivering you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She gripped the arms of the seat and for a while said nothing. Then as the
      train moved on, she spoke somewhat huskily, forcing herself to her point.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you going to carry out your intentions&mdash;as regards&mdash;<i>him?</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has he not been punished enough already?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't understand you,&rdquo; said Sylvester. &ldquo;He has broken the law. He has
      murdered my father. What punishment has he had yet? He shall have his
      deserts,&mdash;whatever term of penal servitude the judge thinks fit to
      give him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For God's sake have mercy, Sylvester!&rdquo; cried the girl, leaning forward in
      her seat, so that her voice should reach him above the rhythmic clatter
      and the creaking of the train. &ldquo;If that happened to him, it would kill me.
      The awful horror of it,&mdash;have you thought?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been trained for years to think deeply before acting, even in
      trivial matters,&rdquo; he replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heaven knows what awful temptation he may have had,&rdquo; said Ella.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A man who cannot resist temptation is better out of the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ella's eyes flashed. The encounter braced her nerves. &ldquo;Have you always
      resisted temptation?&rdquo; she cried in sharp scorn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have lived my life a stainless and an upright man,&rdquo; he replied sternly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So did Christ; but he had pity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not Christ. I am mortal, and have my limitations. Listen. This man
      admitted his forgery. Out of regard for you, I was weak enough to allow
      him a chance of escape, on certain definite conditions. These he violated,
      like the scoundrel he is. To let him loose now on society would be a crime
      on my part.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To pardon the man who has wronged you would be the higher action,&rdquo; said
      Ella.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be mere weakness,&rdquo; replied Sylvester.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ella threw out her hands in a gesture of despair, and flung herself back
      against the cushions. Then suddenly she bent forward again, and laid a
      hand upon his knee.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For my sake, Sylvester! To save me from the shame and disgrace of it. To
      save me from the endless horror of what he will be suffering. My God! Do
      you think that he was nothing to me? That a man can be snatched from a
      woman's life to degradation without her feeling it? Do you think I am
      bloodless marble like you? Oh, I could not live with the thought of it....
      It is not that I love him still. I hope never to see his face again. God
      knows whether I ever really loved him. But if this happens I could not
      live. I could not live, I tell you! You cannot do it. You shall not do it.
      You owe me a reparation&mdash;yes, you,&rdquo; she continued passionately. &ldquo;You
      said just now you had lived a stainless and upright life. It is a lie. It
      is not an upright thing to win a girl's love and then cast it aside.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop, Ella,&rdquo; interrupted Sylvester; &ldquo;you are talking of things you do not
      understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I not understand? Does the man who is lashed not understand the pain? You
      made me love you two years ago. I gave you my heart, a young girl's heart,
      fresh and whole. You kissed me. You said in looks and all but spoken words
      that you were going to ask me to be your wife. For a whole day I lived
      like a tremulous fool waiting for you. You never came. You never spoke
      again. I put away my woman's pride and offered myself&mdash;that evening.
      You rejected me with cold cynicism. You wronged me cruelly. You owe me
      reparation. Give it to me now,&mdash;this man's freedom. I claim it as a
      right from you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was reckless in her self-revelation. Words came now too readily. She
      continued. What she said, she did not remember afterwards. Only that she
      had sunk on her knees before him, pleading passionately for Roderick, and
      that he had remained unmoved.
    </p>
    <p>
      But as she knelt there, clutching his clothes, she looked exceedingly
      beautiful. With an impatient gesture she had thrust up her veil, and the
      sight of her young, noble face lit with terrible earnestness was a shock
      of strange temptation to the man. She pleaded for Roderick. A spasm of
      disgust, similar to that which had shaken him a month or two back when he
      had seen her yield to Roderick's caress, passed through him and held him
      speechless.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another stoppage of the train broke the situation. Ella shrank back into
      the corner of her seat. Sylvester rose and crossing to the further window
      opened it, and looked out upon the platform. As soon as they moved on, he
      drew up the glass again and turned to her, his heart hardened tenfold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did all that was possible,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I thought I cared for you. I
      found to my regret you were utterly indifferent to me. To have asked you
      to marry me would have been impossible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, for Heaven's sake say no more!&rdquo; cried the girl, shrinking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps it is best,&rdquo; replied Sylvester. &ldquo;My determination is absolute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And so they sat silent, facing each other, as the train carried them
      onwards through the darkness.

      CHAPTER XIX&mdash;THE SWORD FALLS
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">&ldquo;"O</span> H, Syl, I can't
      tell you how glad I am that you are back. And Ella too&mdash;with that
      hateful marriage broken off. I don't quite understand how it is. He backed
      out at the last moment, didn't he? But my poor head has been in such a
      whirl all day that I don't seem to understand anything. Dr. Simmons is
      very kind and clever, but he's not like you, Syl. Your coming gives me
      hope. Oh, you mustn't let him die, Syl, dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Lanyon put her hands on Sylvester's shoulders and began to cry
      softly. He put his arm kindly round her, and tried to comfort her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've been crying all day, I think,&rdquo; she continued. The poor lady's eyes
      were red; her grizzling hair, usually so neat, was disarranged; she wore
      an old red dressing-gown with great white buttons, within which her
      fragile figure seemed to be lost. The dining-room fire was nearly out, and
      only one gas-jet was alight. The two were sitting up, neither able to go
      to bed and sleep. Ella had retired to her room almost immediately after
      her arrival, having learned that the old man was unconscious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He rallied so to-day,&rdquo; said Miss Lanyon, drying her tears, &ldquo;I thought the
      poor dear had suddenly recovered. He spoke quite sensibly, though he was
      so weak, and, oh, he wanted you so badly, Syl. And then Lady Milmo's
      telegram came about the wedding, and I gave it him to read. No, you
      mustn't scold me any more about it. I thought he would be so pleased. Then
      he asked where you had gone, and when you were coming back, quite in his
      old quiet way, and called for writing materials, and he wrote something
      with great, great difficulty, and made nurse and me witness his signature.
      It must have been to do with his will, I think. He had just time to put it
      in an envelope when he fainted away. He revived afterwards, and then he
      began to moan for you and Ella to come to him. He didn't like the nurse;
      the strange face troubled him, poor darling. He only wanted Ella and you.
      And now you have come and seen him, what do you really think, Syl, dear?
      If it is the worst, tell me, for I am not afraid to hear it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She drew herself up with a flash of family resemblance to her brother,
      which the physician's quick eye noticed. He replied frankly. The old man
      was in a natural sleep,&mdash;a hopeful sign. His recovery would probably
      depend upon his power of resistance. Lytton, the great specialist, was
      coming down to-morrow, and they might expect his verdict to be final.
    </p>
    <p>
      They talked long together in the cold, dimly lit room. Miss Lanyon
      repeated her story, with fresh details added here and there, told of the
      kindness of Simmons, the numberless inquiries from the townspeople, broke
      off to recall little instances of her brother's goodness. Only to-day,
      during his short spell of consciousness, he had asked whether Sylvester
      had made the arrangement for the Jenkins' three children to board with the
      Jellicoes. At this announcement Sylvester brought his hand down hard upon
      the table. \
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a brute I am!&rdquo; he exclaimed! &ldquo;I forgot all about it! And he
      remembered! What did you tell him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I said that you no doubt were seeing to the matter,&rdquo; replied Miss Lanyon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sylvester sat on the corner of the table and stared in front of him, his
      mind full of the father the latchet of whose shoes he felt himself
      unworthy to loosen, and tears came into his eyes. The incident touched him
      deeply. This tender thoughtfulness for little things in the midst of
      events great enough to absorb the attention of a strong man seemed a
      keynote of his father's nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is the one perfect man of his generation,&rdquo; said Sylvester.
    </p>
    <p>
      A while later he induced Miss Lanyon to go to bed, and went upstairs to
      relieve the nurse by his father's side. And for some hours he watched the
      beloved face, placid and wan in the dim light. Skilled physician though he
      was, he alternated between hope and fear. A world without his father was
      unimaginable. His life was barren enough already. His father was the only
      being left that could satisfy the dumb craving for human sympathy that
      gnawed continually at his vitals. The prospect of his grim loneliness
      appalled him. Again he looked intently into the sleeping face. The muscles
      all relaxed, it appeared unutterably careworn,&mdash;the face of a man
      many years older. To the son seemed as if the last two days had brought
      the havoc; he cursed Roderick in his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only once before had he felt the same murderous hatred of a man. Then he
      was watching, even as he was doing now, by a man's bedside. The memory
      recurred, intensely vivid. He set his teeth as he lived over again those
      hours of agony and strife. Unconsciously he drew up his indictment of
      humanity for the wrongs it had inflicted on him. Friendship was naught.
      Had not his dearest friend stabbed him in the dark? Woman was inherently
      false and corrupt. His own wife, who had lain in his arms, had betrayed
      him, and she had smiled, smiled to the hour of her death. To have children
      was a curse. How did he know that alien blood did not run in Dorothy's
      veins? Woman's love, what was it? To-night Ella had confessed her love for
      him. It had not stopped her from throwing herself into the embraces of a
      satyr. The brute nature of humanity! He himself had not been safeguarded
      from spasms of jealousy. Fiercely he attributed them to the lower
      instincts. He forgot how at times in his sombre house he had let his pen
      slip from his fingers and had ached for the touch of a woman's hand and
      the sound of a child's laughter; how a girl's fresh face, perilously like
      Ella's, had quivered before his vision, and how the grip of cold iron had
      suddenly fastened round his heart, and he had resumed his work, hard and
      scornful. These things that had come to him were remote from the flesh;
      but he forgot them. In his hour of dark misanthropy he ranked her sex and
      his own temptation at their lowest. For her humiliation he had no pity.
      Like other women, she had rolled in the mire; smirching was the natural
      consequence. For Roderick he had hatred, unmitigated by any pleasant
      memory of old acquaintance. But he remembered his father's many kindnesses
      to Roderick, and the man's crime was further blackened by ingratitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor did he pity the father of the son thus disgraced. The ignoble, mean
      old man who had always been the object of his scorn had brought his
      punishment upon himself; for had he not neglected the elementary
      responsibilities of parentage? There could be no pity for a father of whom
      the son spoke openly with cynical contempt. Sylvester's eyes fell upon his
      own father's face, and the contrast brought a tumultuous rush of feeling.
      And from the wall opposite, his mother smiled down upon him through the
      gloom. She was gone,&mdash;the one pure, divine woman the earth had held.
      The one perfect man lay there, still living. He must not die. Sylvester
      shook with a great terror. His father was as needful as the sun in a foul
      and dismal world. These two were remote as stars from the rest of
      humanity. Through them passed his faith in God.
    </p>
    <p>
      But his faith in man was gone. On this night of vigil, after his day of
      self-repression and stern meting out of justice, was the culmination of
      all the disillusion and the bitterness of his life. Towards the three
      human beings upon whom he was bringing crushing disgrace his heart was
      cold granite. And the old man with the kindly, careworn face slept on and
      on by his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the first streaks of the winter dawn the door opened, and Ella, simply
      dressed for the day, entered the room. Sylvester rose with a frown and
      advanced to meet her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must take my turn,&rdquo; she whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no necessity,&rdquo; he returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have passed through great trouble,&rdquo; she said, looking at him with eyes
      pathetically bright through want of sleep, &ldquo;and it would be mere human
      kindness to let me sit here for a little alone. And you must take some
      rest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thank you for your consideration,&rdquo; he replied ironically, ignoring her
      appeal, &ldquo;but I am not in need of rest.&rdquo; He held the door open for her to
      pass out, but she stood her ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are hard, but you claim to be just. Uncle Matthew sent for me. Aunt
      Agatha has told you. I have some right to be here. Besides, it would hurt
      him to know that you refused to let me be with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you put it that way, I must admit your claim,&rdquo; he said coldly. &ldquo;If you
      will come into the passage, I will give you some directions in view of
      contingencies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She assented, and they went out together. At the end of the passage a
      housemaid passed wraithlike on her way to the kitchen. The crack of the
      stairs beneath her tread sounded sharp in the unbroken silence of the
      house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, I will not forget,&rdquo; said Ella, when he had ended his
      instructions. She disappeared into the sick chamber; and Sylvester, going
      to his own room, threw himself in his clothes upon the bed, and wrapped in
      a rug fell, through force of habit and through fatigue, into a heavy
      sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      A couple of hours afterwards he was awakened. Mr. Usher urgently requested
      to speak with him. Sylvester rose, shook the sleep from his eyes, and
      faced the grim contingencies of another day. He was prepared for this
      interview with the father, had steeled himself against whining entreaties
      and appeals to old comradeship. But to see him was an act of common
      decency, however unpleasant and however fruitless. He sponged his face
      with ice-cold water and went downstairs to the dining-room. Mr. Usher was
      sitting on the edge of an armchair, warming his plump hands before the
      fire. He rose as Sylvester entered, and, putting his hands behind his
      back, regarded him with eyes more than ever expressionless and red-rimmed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had a telegram from my poor boy last night,&rdquo; he announced in his slow,
      pedantic way. &ldquo;I could not come round last night. I have been suffering
      again lately from my bronchial tubes. My doctor tells me the night air in
      winter is dangerous for me. I was a prisoner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your health is valuable to you, no doubt,&rdquo; said Sylvester, sarcastically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I live for my son,&rdquo; replied Usher, sitting down again in the armchair.
      &ldquo;If I ran risks now and contracted illness, who would stand by my son in
      his hour of need? Prudence has been the guiding principle of my life. I
      have profited by it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He wagged his head and looked into the fire. Sylvester turned one of the
      straight-backed chairs and sat down, his elbow on the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps you will state your business, Mr. Usher,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;My time, like
      your health, is valuable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All in good time,&rdquo; replied Usher; &ldquo;nothing good comes of hurrying. I
      never hurry.&rdquo; He rubbed his palms together meditatively, like some
      colossal and flabby fly. Then he continued deliberately: &ldquo;I learn from
      Roderick that he has been arrested for forging your father's name to a
      cheque.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For £3,000,&rdquo; said Sylvester.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. It is a great sum of money. But your father gave it to him as a
      wedding present. Your father is a generous man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your son confessed to me that he forged it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, perhaps he did,&rdquo; assented Usher. &ldquo;Perhaps he did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In spite of his contempt for the old man and his pitilessness towards
      Roderick, he gazed upon his interlocutor with some wonder. Not a shaft of
      dismay at the disgrace hanging over his son's head seemed to have
      penetrated the brass-armoured egotism of this placid, unvenerable man.
      Sylvester waited contemptuously for him to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are preferring the charge against him this morning?&rdquo; asked Usher.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have instructed my solicitor to do so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is still time to telegraph to your solicitor to withdraw it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no such intentions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot let you proceed. I have the feelings of a father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sylvester rose, and thrusting his hands in his pockets, stood on the
      hearth-rug facing Mr. Usher.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is no doubt a painful matter to you,&rdquo; said he, with cold politeness,
      &ldquo;but my intentions are unalterable. I will prosecute him right through.
      Nothing you can possibly say will have the slightest effect on my
      determination.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then the old man seemed to hug his stout body with his arms, and for the
      first time a gleam came into his pale eyes and he chuckled softly to
      himself. At the unexpected sound Sylvester started. Such symptoms pointed
      to senility. But suddenly the old man turned to him with a quick snarl, in
      startling contrast with his deliberate manner,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you are not aware, you young fool, that you will be sending
      your own brother to gaol.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He bent forward, gripping the arms of the chair, fixing Sylvester with an
      inscrutable gaze, his lips beneath the scrubby white moustache parted and
      showing his yellow stumps of teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your brother. Don't you understand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What idiocy are you talking?&rdquo; exclaimed Sylvester, in angry impatience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am talking the truth, my young friend. I am a truthful man,&rdquo; replied
      Usher, with mocking resumption of his usual habit of speech. &ldquo;Roderick is
      your own dear brother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You accuse my father of having an illegitimate son?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no. Roderick is quite legitimate. He is my son. At least, I quite
      believed your poor mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My mother&mdash;what the devil are you talking about?&rdquo; cried Sylvester,
      fiercely. &ldquo;What has my mother got to do with it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Roderick is her son, my dear Sylvester. Hers and mine. She was my wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sylvester glared at him for a moment, and then, the preposterous absurdity
      of the story dawning upon him, he broke into a contemptuous laugh and
      turned away. The man was mad.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think it time we parted,&rdquo; said Sylvester. Ushers face expressed pained
      surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do not believe me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then as Sylvester did not reply otherwise than by a shrug, he drew a mass
      of papers from his breast-pocket and selected therefrom a photograph, old
      and discoloured, of a man and woman posed in the angular attitudes of the
      photographer's art in the late fifties, and clad in the uncouth attire of
      those days. The woman had a baby upon her lap.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your mother and brother and I,&rdquo; said Mr. Usher. &ldquo;I was a handsome young
      man. I had fine black whiskers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sylvester received the picture, looked at it, and a spasm of horrible
      disgust shook his frame. The young woman was his mother&mdash;unmistakably.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She was my dear wife,&rdquo; said Usher.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you played the brute beast, I suppose, until she divorced you. And
      then she married my father. I see,&rdquo; said Sylvester, grimly.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Usher raised his hand in deprecation. &ldquo;On the contrary,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;we
      were never divorced. When I said your father had no illegitimate children,
      I was wrong. You are an illegitimate child.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sylvester flung the photograph with a furious gesture into the fire. The
      old man darted forward to rescue it, but Sylvester roughly pushed him back
      into his chair, and stood over him trembling with anger. Behind him the
      photograph curled and flamed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What devilish story are you telling me? Let me have it at once, all of
      it,&rdquo; cried Sylvester.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a slight pause. Usher passed the tip of his tongue over his
      lips, and again he hugged himself in his armchair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been waiting to tell you this for thirty years. For your dear
      father's sake I have held my peace. I am a peaceful man. But I could not
      let you send your own brother to prison, your dear mother's son. Fraternal
      love is a wondrous thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come to the point and tell me, or I may not be responsible for what I
      do,&rdquo; said Sylvester, in husky menace.
    </p>
    <p>
      The swelling triumph of his long-deferred vengeance had not quite
      overmastered a craven spirit. A glance out of the corner of his eye
      assured Usher of Sylvester's desperation. The sight was an unholy mingling
      of delight and fear. He rubbed his soft palms together and wagged his
      head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a sad story. I blame my wife. She acted wrongly. We lived in
      Australia on a little farm. I am fond of rural pursuits. Ayresford is
      rural. That is why I came here. We were married and happy with our little
      child. We called him Roderick. It is a family name, but perhaps that would
      not interest you. He was three years old when your father came to these
      parts. Ah! he was a dashing young fellow then. He is not dashing now. Poor
      Matthew!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Damn you!&rdquo; said Sylvester.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! that is what your father has often said. You are like your father.
      Well, to shorten a long story, he fell in love with my wife, and she with
      him, and she ran away with him to England, leaving me alone with our poor
      little boy Roderick. Here are proofs.&rdquo; He patted the sheaf of papers on
      his lap and signed to Sylvester to read them; but Sylvester motioned a
      negative. He was convinced. His anger had subsided into he knew not what
      state of reeling horror. Yet through it all Usher himself was revealed to
      him, and he regarded him as something obscene.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you have received money from my father all this time as the price of
      silence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was poor, and I forgave mine enemy. I am a forgiving man. It is my way.
      When your dear mother died I came here and lived near him, to show that I
      forgave him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like father, like son,&rdquo; said Sylvester,&mdash;&ldquo;a blackmailer and a
      forger. Oh, my God!&rdquo; He turned away and stood with bowed head, staring at
      the carpet, his hands clenched. Without moving he said hoarsely,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go. We have nothing more to say to each other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see you can't let your dear brother go to a felon's doom&mdash;and
      your legitimate brother, too, my dear Sylvester,&rdquo; said Usher, smacking his
      lips at each word. Then he rose and buttoned his frock-coat and went out
      of the room, chuckling quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently Sylvester roused himself with a great shuddering sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, God!&rdquo; he said, and moved a step or two towards the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a knock at the door and a servant entered, bearing a letter on a
      tray.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Lanyon said I was to give you this at once, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took it, found the envelope was addressed to himself in his father's
      handwriting. He did not notice that the ink on the envelope was wet, nor
      that the enclosure had been written some time previously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I, Matthew Lanyon,&rdquo; it ran, &ldquo;of Woodlands, Ayresford, hereby declare that
      I drew a cheque for £3,000, dated the 10th December, 189-, in favour of
      Roderick Charles Usher, Esq., of 13 Queen's Park Mansions, London, S. W.&rdquo;
       The document was signed by him, and the signature was witnessed by Agatha
      Lanyon and Mary Evans, the nurse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like a man in a dream, Sylvester crossed to a little desk by the window,
      that once had been his mother's, and wrote out a telegram; then a letter
      with which he enclosed his father's statement. Both he addressed to his
      solicitor. The gardener was summoned and despatched to the post-office.
      When he had gone, Sylvester was scarcely conscious of his action.
      Roderick's fate was of small account compared with the doom that had
      fallen upon himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      But an hour afterwards Roderick was driving through the London streets, a
      free man.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XX&mdash;&ldquo;OH, WHITE DOVE OF THE PITY DIVINE&rdquo;
     </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">B</span>ut a few minutes
      had passed since Usher's departure; yet to Sylvester they represented a
      great chasm of time,&mdash;a living self on the one side, a dead self on
      the other. He walked aimlessly about the room in a curious apathy. That
      which had been vital to him, his love and reverence for those two,&mdash;father
      and mother,&mdash;had been plucked away from him, and it seemed merely
      some reflex action that maintained organic existence.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the wall facing the fireplace were two companion water-colour portraits
      in old-fashioned oval frames. He paused before them and looked dully from
      one to the other. These had been his sacred images in the house, the ikons
      of his gods. His mother smiled down upon him. Her hair, banded obliquely
      on either side over her forehead, gave an idea of Madonna-like purity to
      the delicate contours of her face. That of Botticelli's fair girl-mother
      betrayed less a soul at war with itself. And it was not the artist's
      contemporaneous delight in investing feminine portraiture with angelic
      sentimentality that was at fault. The son remembered her thus in the
      flesh, though older,&mdash;a rare, flower-like woman, with hands that,
      when they touched him as a boy, seemed holy. She was dead. That other, the
      young man bright and strong, looking unflinchingly at the world over his
      absurd black neckcloth, was now an old man, dying. And all that they left
      was a heritage of shame.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their lives had been a hollow, hideous lie,&mdash;the lives of his gods.
      <i>A fortiori</i>, the lives of common mortality were false. He seemed to
      stand apart from the world, dispassionately regarding a race corrupt to
      its core, and shrinking from the step that would bring him again into its
      midst. Without Phariseeism he appeared to be the one clean man in a miry
      universe; the sense whereof brought with it something of the appalling.
      Whither should he turn without rubbing against contamination?
    </p>
    <p>
      He moved away from the pictures and looked about the room. The familiar,
      old-fashioned furniture, which the old man loved to keep in memory of her
      who was once queen of the little space, seemed tainted with the
      unutterable. He became aware of a physical feeling of nausea. The room
      reeked. He flung open one of the French windows with an instinctive
      craving for a breath of the cold December air that was blown across the
      dripping lawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      He brushed aside his hair, and tried to think. He stood as a judge; that
      he realised. Those two were brought before the bar, accused of the sin
      that his organic temperament pronounced unforgivable. The pleas in
      extenuation would be weakness and folly; and weakness and folly he
      despised. He was called upon to pass sentence for the shame of which he
      himself was the child; and in passing it on the sinful pair he was
      condemning himself to a living death. The man did not see that he had been
      working all his life towards this doom.
    </p>
    <p>
      The slamming of the door behind him caused him to turn round with a start.
      His Aunt Agatha came towards him, wrapping a woollen shawl tightly around
      her lean shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, how can you have the windows open on a day like this?&rdquo; she asked
      shivering.
    </p>
    <p>
      He closed the window in silence and looked at her inquiringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your father has been awake a long time, dear, and is asking so for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A long time?&rdquo; he echoed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; before Mr. Usher came. Didn't you know? He addressed the envelope of
      the letter he sent down to you. Didn't you get it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I got it,&rdquo; said Sylvester.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the matter with you, Syl? Aren't you going to him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, of course,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;Of course&mdash;yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He went out slowly and mounted the stairs with limbs as heavy as lead. He
      turned the handle of his father's door and entered. The kind grey eyes of
      the old man, propped on his pillows, met him as he crossed the threshold,
      and a smile flickered over the wan lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was afraid you had forgotten me,&rdquo; whispered the old man, feebly holding
      out his hand, which his son pressed in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ella was standing in the light of the window, medicine bottle and glass in
      hand. Until the liquid was poured out, she paid no attention to Sylvester.
      Then she came to the bedside and looked across at him somewhat defiantly
      before handing the glass to his father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the use of this solemn little comedy?&rdquo; said the latter,
      whimsically, his voice, a whispered echo of the cheeriness of days past.
      &ldquo;It won't make me any better. Simmons knows it and you know it and I know
      it. All the king's horses and all the king's men! And Humpty Dumpty
      doesn't want to be set up again. He's been on his wall long enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He drank the draught, however, making a wry face. Ella bent over to wipe
      his lips, but he motioned her away with characteristic independence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can do that for myself. I can't do much, but I can do that. You don't
      know how she bullies me, Syl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Uncle Matthew wouldn't have the nurse when she came to relieve me,&rdquo;
       explained Ella.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want those I love best by me, as now, eh, Syl?&rdquo; said the old man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sylvester did not answer, but stood by the bedside dumb, vainly seeking
      some formula of speech whereby to simulate emotion. Ella set the
      wine-glass on the table and smoothed the pillows and counterpane, then
      lingered by the sick man, looking down upon him with a puckering of the
      brow, as a woman will, counting over the little tale of duties specified
      by the forth-driven nurse, so as to make certain of no omission. But her
      presence there filled Sylvester with dull resentment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My father has something particular to say to me,&rdquo; he said stiffly. &ldquo;Do
      you mind?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was on the point of going,&rdquo; she replied, somewhat surprised at feeling
      hurt by his tone, for she had thought that the successive emotional shocks
      of the past four and twenty hours had killed all feeling within her for
      ever. Recovering herself, she bent over the old man, kissed him, and
      crossed to the door. Sylvester met her there and accompanied her into the
      passage and closed the door behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much does my father know of Roderick Usher's affairs?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him bravely enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing. I believe he guesses. I have told him he was summoned abroad
      suddenly.&rdquo; She moved away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;There is something else.&rdquo; She drew a step nearer. &ldquo;I
      can't bear much more,&rdquo; she said quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It may relieve your mind to know that I have withdrawn the charge
      entirely. He is perfectly free.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stared at him for a moment, then grew deadly white and fainted. The
      girl's overtaxed strength had given way at last. Sylvester caught her in
      his arms and prepared to carry her to her room not far off along the
      passage; but at that moment Miss Agatha Lanyon with Simmons turned the
      corner, and he gave Ella into their charge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm staying with my father,&rdquo; he said to Simmons. &ldquo;Come in later.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On the other side of his father's door he forgot the recent scene. Of what
      importance was a girl's fainting compared with the death hovering in this
      chamber and the death enthroned in his heart? He approached the bed.
      Matthew looked up at him wistfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can't expect me to live for ever, you know. I really have had enough
      of it, so don't fret.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A thrush fluttered against the window for a moment. Matthew started.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only a bird beating against the pane, attracted by the fire, perhaps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We do that all our lives long. The invisible barrier. Oh, it's time to
      go, Syl, when a man begins to moralise. The moral always comes at the end
      of the story. Sit down on the bed, my son. I want to talk to you.&rdquo;
       Sylvester obeyed. An expression of pain crossed his face. The old man's
      undismayed serenity moved his admiration. He would have given worlds to
      have uttered the cry of grief and love that would have been possible an
      hour ago.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a brave man, father,&rdquo; he forced himself to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; a coward. A pitiable old coward. You received my letter this
      morning?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. It is all right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You found a cheque yesterday&mdash;thought it forged&mdash;stopped Ella's
      marriage?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and brought her back with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you will believe that I wrote the cheque?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you wish me to,&rdquo; said Sylvester.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a silence broken only by the crackling of the fire and the
      sobbing of the wind outside among the bare trees. Matthew gazed at the
      patch of sky framed by the window&mdash;it was one of his little
      obstinacies to have the fullest daylight in his room&mdash;and watched the
      scudding clouds. Presently, without turning,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Syl,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something is breaking my heart. It has been the dream of my life to leave
      you a little fortune to make you independent, but I have lost it all,
      nearly all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must not be distressed at that,&rdquo; replied Sylvester. &ldquo;I am earning a
      good income and am putting by money. In twenty years I shall be a wealthy
      man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Matthew turned a face of intense anxiety, and it was some seconds before
      he could speak in his feeble voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Woodlands will have to go. It is heavily mortgaged,&mdash;a debt I
      owe to Usher. Forgive me, Syl; I tried so hard to keep it. You'll find
      Usher and Roderick in my will, you the residuary legatee; but there will
      be nothing. I will explain a little.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused, thinking of some explanation, a debt incurred to Usher long
      ago. But Sylvester, imagining the story to be the one of sickening shame
      he had just heard, sought to save the old man unnecessary pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't say anything. Usher has told me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Matthew looked at him wide-eyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Usher told you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everything?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From the beginning?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. This morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were threatening Roderick with a prosecution?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. When I learned that he was&mdash;my brother, I instructed my
      solicitor to withdraw the charge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Merciful God, have pity on me!&rdquo; murmured the old man, with closed eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tremendous irony of existence crushed him. To save his son this
      knowledge, he had endured over thirty years of abject humiliation. The son
      by his own act had brought the knowledge upon himself. It is an awful
      thing when a strong man comes face to face with the futile result of all
      his strength.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently he opened his eyes and looked wearily at Sylvester.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive me, Syl. Don't judge after the penalty has been paid. Even common
      law cannot sentence a man twice for the same offence. And I 've served my
      time, and so did she. My God! we served it twice over. And no one knew or
      pitied us. I would have killed myself cheerfully to spare you the
      knowledge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His voice weakened, and he murmured an inaudible sentence, then lay back
      exhausted on his pillows. Sylvester looked at the kind, strong face, now
      so ashen and aged, and a gleam was revealed to him of the spirit's tragedy
      beneath; confused and blurred, it is true, but still a gleam that filled
      him with vague disquietude. It dimly suggested possibilities of life
      beyond the jealously guarded gates of his soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must have pity, my son,&rdquo; whispered Matthew.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tone wrung the young man's heart like a material grip. It was the
      first sign of returning power of sensation. He cleared his throat and said
      constrainedly,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't talk like that, father. I am your son and must always honour you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Matthew again turned his head and watched the grey sky. He knew his son to
      be a stern man, and the austere sound of his words chilled him more than
      the death he felt approaching.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What can I do?&rdquo; he murmured, dispirited. &ldquo;It was a long, long penance.
      Don't turn from me, my son.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;father,&rdquo; said Sylvester, brokenly, &ldquo;everything seems to have
      left me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The numbness had gone, and the whole sensitive man writhed in sudden pain,
      with loss of faith. His mother, whom he had deemed holy as a saint, his
      wife whom he had worshipped as a star,&mdash;both to have been false
      wives, women of shame! The old torture revived, intensified tenfold. The
      sight of the once revered being who lay dying in utter sadness before his
      eyes, and for whom the old love was now fighting within him for mastery,
      raised the torture's poignancy to such a pitch that at last it broke
      through the reserve of a lifetime and found vent in a great cry,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My own wife was unfaithful to me. How, can I judge my mother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A flush of life entered the dying man's cheeks. He turned quickly; his
      eyes were luminous.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Constance? I did not think you knew&mdash;till the other night. And then
      I hoped against hope.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you know? How long? I only learned it after her death&mdash;Leroux's
      last illness. My God! does all the country-side know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Syl. I alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He sought his son's hand on the coverlet, and then continued in the calm,
      assured tone that Sylvester knew had given strength and comfort to so
      many. The voice had grown suddenly strong.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She came to me herself, and told me, a soul-stricken woman,&mdash;just
      after. She loved the man, Syl, and had always loved him. Circumstances
      estranged them, they thought for ever. And then&mdash;she was a brave
      woman, Syl&mdash;she fancied she could make a good man's life happy,&mdash;yours.
      But the mistake was cleared up, and he returned. She loved him,&mdash;my
      boy, we can't kill love,&mdash;but she was proud of her honour and scorned
      running from temptation; relied on her strength too far, until one day,
      only one day, Syl, it failed her, in a whirl of madness. She came to me to
      ask what she should do. I have never seen such frantic grief in a human
      soul. And a good many have brought their troubles to me,&rdquo; he added with
      one of his rare smiles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is true,&rdquo; said Sylvester. And a sudden impulse made him add, &ldquo;God
      bless you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For the thought, of a soul in pain flying instinctively to the sympathy of
      those kind eyes brought a gush of tenderness. He saw him again as the wise
      counsellor, the generous friend, the child-hearted lover of all things,
      great and small.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you told her&mdash;?&rdquo; he queried in a low voice, deeply moved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A greater judge than I set the precedent. She was the truest wife to you
      thereafter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me, father,&rdquo; said Sylvester, huskily, &ldquo;when was it? Dorothy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your own flesh and blood,&rdquo; said the old man, gripping his hand. &ldquo;My poor
      boy, how you must have suffered!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He lay back again, prostrated by his sustained effort of speech, and
      closed his eyes. Sylvester leaned forward, half reclining on the bed,
      still holding his father's hand. And as he sat there silent, a veil seemed
      to be drawn from before his vision.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&mdash;Constance must have suffered,&rdquo; he said at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      Matthew opened his eyes and met his son's gaze wistfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't we all? If the stainless like you suffer, what of us poor sinners
      who struggle towards the light! Think of the agony of that pure and
      delicate soul who bore you, my son. Pray for all poor souls, Syl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His voice had grown singularly faint. The tears leaped to Sylvester's
      eyes. He tried to speak, but his throat was clogged with unaccustomed
      sobs. With instinctive ashamedness he buried his face in the pillow next
      to his father, still holding his hand. He lay there a long time, his heart
      aching with the returning love as a limb to which the tourniquet has been
      applied aches with the returning blood. Once the old man whispered a
      prayer for the son's forgiveness, and when Sylvester pressed his hand,
      relapsed into his half-sleep as if reassured. Time went by. Presently
      Sylvester heard him murmuring in a scarcely audible voice. Gradually the
      sense of the words came to him. The old man was repeating scraps of verse:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      &ldquo;Freres humains, qui apres nous vivez,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      N'avez les cueurs contre nous endurciz,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Car, si pitié de nous pouvres avez,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Dieu en aura plustost de vous merciz.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Ne soyez done de nostre confrairie,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Mais priez Dieu que tous nous vueille absouldre!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a great pathos in the broad English accent with which he
      murmured the old French words, and for the first time in all his life
      Sylvester understood them. He raised his head and saw his father's lips
      moving dumbly. After a little the voice came again, broken and faint, and
      only by a word here and there could he gather the meaning. It was from
      Swinburne's &ldquo;Garden of Proserpine:&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent30">
      &ldquo;... Even the weariest river
    </p>
    <p class="indent30">
      Winds somewhere safe to sea,&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      He repeated the couplet two or three times. He had never been a great
      reader of poetry, but of some half-dozen poems he was particularly fond,
      and had made them his own, and had woven them into the texture of his
      life. Among them were such dissimilar things as Villon's &ldquo;Ballade,&rdquo;
       Macaulay's &ldquo;Battle of Ivry,&rdquo; Tennyson's &ldquo;Brook,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Ancient Mariner,&rdquo;
       and Sylvester had often smiled indulgently at this little anthology, his
      father's simple spiritual equipment. Especially had he wondered at his
      assimilation of this poem of Swinburne's, so remote in feeling from his
      steadfast outlook upon life, and his intolerance of cowardly shrinking
      from its responsibilities.
    </p>
    <p>
      But now he comprehended that his father was a weary, weary man, and that
      one of the most beautiful of all utterances to the weary man's heart had
      brought him comfort.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      &ldquo;Then star nor sun shall waken,
    </p>
    <p class="indent30">
      Nor any change of light;
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Nor sound of waters shaken,
    </p>
    <p class="indent30">
      Nor any sound or sight;
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Nor wintry leaves nor vernal;
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Nor days nor things diurnal;
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Only the sleep eternal
    </p>
    <p class="indent30">
      In an eternal night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The murmuring voice ended the poem. Sylvester drew the old man's withered
      brown hand to his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive me for not understanding, father,&rdquo; he said brokenly. &ldquo;I am glad I
      know. I love you and my mother more than I have ever done. Would to God I
      had been a tenderer son to you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Matthew's clasp tightened, and a smile hovered over his face. He knew that
      the awkward words came from his son's heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We understand each other, Syl. '<i>Tout comprendre</i>, et cetera.... I
      am happy. I have never been so happy in all my life&mdash;'the burden has
      fallen from me&mdash;fallen into the sea.' I'm sleepy, Syl&mdash;stay by
      me&mdash;it comforts me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So Sylvester, still holding the dear hand in a warm clasp, and fearing to
      move lest he should disturb the quiet slumber into which the old man had
      fallen, remained by his father's side, his face hidden in the pillow. And
      as he lay, there was accomplished one of those integral spiritual changes
      that can only be wrought once in the lifetime of a man here and there. The
      White Dove of the Divine Pity overshadowed him with its wings, and he saw
      deeply into the mysteries of life. He beheld the unutterable pathos of
      man, his clogged aspirations, his heroic weakness, his piteous fortitude,
      his everlasting struggles. It was revealed to him that there may be more
      of the warm spiritual essence of humanity, in a single passionate sin than
      in a hundred austere virtues.
    </p>
    <p>
      His father, mother, Constance, Leroux, Ella, all of whom he, the upright,
      stainless man, had condemned, stood before him clothed in a new light; and
      by reason of their warm humanity, their struggles, their sufferings, they
      stood higher in the scale of being than he.
    </p>
    <p>
      He saw the loves of those two whom he had so cherished unfold in tragedy
      before his vision. They were two rare natures, he understood, fitted only
      one for the other, too fine for commoner clay. He knew the agony of the
      first early struggle, the eternal conflict between love and that which the
      world accepts as duty; the mother's heart torn asunder between the child
      of her body and the man of her heart's core; the ignoble husband a thing
      of horror in her thoughts. Then came their life together; the perfect
      union; the sweet community of noble end; but every step to happiness
      dogged by the footfall of pain. What must they have suffered, the two
      sensitives, with minds (in the son's fancy) of gods and hearts of little
      children! He remembered that there were times when his mother would stand
      by the window, lost to external things, and strain her vision through
      infinite space; and he knew now it was the yearning for the child that she
      had forsaken.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then she died, the pure gold of her spirit worn thin by suffering. He
      remembered his father's ashen face; how he clung unspeaking to him, even
      as he himself in after years had clung to Dorothy. Then came the proud
      man's lonely penance; Usher's arrival with Roderick. He had wronged the
      man and wronged the boy; but what unwearying efforts to redeem in full!
      The weight of the burden fell upon Sylvester, and he knew its heaviness.
      He knew the scrupulous gentleman's revolt against the forced intimacy with
      the underbred egotist, lost to self-respect, the rapacious blackmailer,
      the vampire that sucked his heart's blood. He knew the sordid cares of
      money that had fallen on the old man, his struggles to leave his own son
      an independent fortune and the family home, and at the same time to carry
      out his chivalrous vow to give an exact equivalent to the wife's deserted
      child; the agony of effort to spare his son the knowledge. And all that
      had left untouched his tender, generous heart, which all men loved. A new
      reverence arose within Sylvester's soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      And that other,&mdash;Constance? Had she not struggled, silently,
      indomitably, filling his existence with wifely devotion, battling night
      and day with the hydra-headed love that seemed unconquerable? Had she not
      fought and suffered and triumphed? And Leroux? Had he not shared in the
      battle and the suffering and the victory? Had she not, Ella, too, bravely
      striven, seeking light through the darkness that he had cast about her?
      And Roderick? Who was he that he should judge his fellow? The fierce hate
      died for ever in Sylvester's heart. The bewildering knowledge of man's
      infinite weakness, man's infinite strength and endurance, stirred his
      inmost soul with unutterable pity.

    </p>
    <p>
      A touch on the shoulder aroused him. Instinctively he sought to free his
      hand; but the clasp that held it was singularly stiff and cold. He lifted
      his head with a start and looked round. Ella was standing behind him. Then
      he freed himself and leaped to his feet. Their eyes met, then turned to
      the figure on the bed. He bent over, looked intently into his father's
      face, felt his heart. The erring, beautiful life had ended in his sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without a word spoken, they straightened the limbs and smoothed the bed,
      the girl crying silently. As soon as this was done, she whispered,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will leave you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But to her great wonder, he took her hand and raised it to his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;stay.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XXI&mdash;HERITAGE
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>hey buried Matthew
      Lanyon in the quiet churchyard at Ayresford next to the woman who in
      everything but law had been his wife. Half the small town thronged about
      the grave in sorrow. All felt that one of the chosen had dwelt in their
      midst, and that they were poorer by the loss of the kindness of his simple
      heart and the wisdom of his grey head. The four chief mourners stood a
      little way apart, close together. Sylvester held the child Dorothy tight
      by the hand, finding unspeakable comfort in the tiny clasp, and let the
      tears fall fast and unheeded down his face. The grave seemed a chasm that
      separated them from the rest of the world. The child, Agatha Lanyon, Ella,
      and himself stood alone, curiously remote, and united by a new and strange
      bond. For the first time for many years he felt the preciousness of human
      relationship. Of aught save this and his irreparable loss, he was
      unconscious. The crowd was a vague mass dimly seen through a mist of
      tears. He scarcely heard the old rector's voice reciting the familiar
      words. But when the first clod of earth clattered sharply upon the
      coffin-lid, he turned away with a sob; then meeting Ella's swimming eyes,
      he sought her right hand with his left and holding it turned again. And
      never so much as at that moment did he need the strength of human
      tenderness; for looking up he saw standing at the foot of the grave, his
      ignoble figure defined against the old grey church, Usher wagging his bare
      head in simulated sorrow and gazing at the last that was visible of his
      enemy. Then the old man stooped down and threw a lump of earth into the
      pit; and as he rose Sylvester saw an expression of indescribable malice
      pass over his face. Quivering at the supreme insult, the young man turned
      to Ella.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank God,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;nothing can hurt him now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The reference was too pointed for her not to comprehend. She questioned
      him dumbly, feeling suddenly brought to the brink of a revelation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is selfish to wish him back,&rdquo; said Sylvester.
    </p>
    <p>
      They remained a few moments longer. The crowd was slowly disappearing
      through the grey of the early winter twilight. The rector came up with a
      few words of sympathy and crossed the churchyard towards the rectory. The
      grave was nearly full.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; said Ella, gently, and they went to the path where the mourning
      coach awaited them. They spoke but little. Miss Lanyon cried softly to
      herself. Ella leaned back on the cushion with closed eyes. She was very
      weary, spent with emotion; yet the evil spirit of unrest was laid within
      her. The past upheaval had been phantasmagoric, in which her integral self
      had been lost amid a whirling army of unreal shapes. Now, brought into
      contact with an elemental reality, death, and with a deep and simple
      grief, it had emerged clear and definite. For the first time for many
      months the vibrations of her soul rang true, soothing her like sweet, sad
      music after devil's discord. Sylvester's words by the graveside had moved
      her. She remembered now a pain that had often come into the old man's
      eyes, and she wondered reverently. Sylvester sat opposite, his arm around
      Dorothy, who looked up shyly yet gladly into his face, unable to explain
      to her childish mind this revulsion of passionate love. To him it was a
      happiness that flooded his soul. The parched places drank it in like the
      river of life. He was a new man, able to feel in all its sacredness the
      sorrow that had come.
    </p>
    <p>
      His temperament had undergone a curious transmutation. Instead of flying,
      as used to be his wont, to solitude, to brood over his grief, a newly
      awakened instinct drove him imperiously to companionship.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come down soon,&rdquo; he said to the two ladies when, on their arrival at the
      house, they went upstairs to take off their things. And they all sat
      together for the rest of the long evening, and while he talked, Ella
      wondered at his gentleness.
    </p>
    <p>
      At ten o'clock the ladies retired. He accompanied them to the hall and lit
      their candles. Miss Lanyon bade him good-night and disappeared up the
      staircase. Ella held out her hand. He kept it in his for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won't you stay up with me a little longer?&rdquo; he asked humbly. The light of
      the candle played amid the dark gold of her hair and lit up her face, that
      gleamed very pale in contrast with her high black dress. His eyes, resting
      upon her, found her stately and sweet. He forgot that only a few days ago
      he had despised her, classing her with the wanton of an inferior sex. She
      stood before him something noble, helpful, mysterious. In her calm gaze he
      read the certainty of a high companionship. He was dismayed by the sudden
      revelation of his loss.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Willingly,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But I am so tired.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just ten minutes,&rdquo; he pleaded. &ldquo;I hate to be alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You?&rdquo; Surprise was in her tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been alone so much,&rdquo; he replied simply.
    </p>
    <p>
      She blew out her candle and went back with him into the library. Then she
      sat down in Matthew's great leathern chair and watched him as he stirred
      the fire. Much of her bitter resentment against him had died by the old
      man's death-bed. The common sorrow had brought them once more on to the
      plane of old relations. The sudden change in his attitude had helped the
      promptings of her nobler nature, and generously she had given him the
      dumbly craved sympathy. Besides, the old man's tenderness was too fresh a
      memory for her to be harsh now to Sylvester.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fire burst into a blaze. Sylvester drew himself up and stood on the
      hearth-rug looking at her, and all the hardness had gone from his face.
      Suddenly he spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am a poor creature, Ella. I know it now. You have every right to think
      ill of me; but try to think as well as you can&mdash;for the old man's
      sake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The last few days have changed so much,&rdquo; she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Could they bring you to forgive me for all the pain and suffering I have
      caused you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She drew a little sharp breath. &ldquo;We need never speak of that again. It is
      behind us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it is beginning to be very present with me,&rdquo; he answered gravely.
      &ldquo;Lately my eyes have been opened to many things. Some day I may find it in
      my power to tell you how. I have wronged you cruelly and unjustly. I would
      give much to make atonement&mdash;but one can never atone. One can only
      crave forgiveness&mdash;and pity for a blind man. I feel I can ask it of
      you now. Since you have been here you too have shown me things I never
      knew of. For nearly two years I have given you every reason to hate me.
      You have put all aside, treated me with a sister's gentleness, given me
      all your sympathy and tenderness. I am not accustomed to perceive large
      and generous natures.... I will make a confession. In my morbid arrogance
      and folly, I put myself upon a pedestal and regarded you, God forgive me,
      as something beneath me. You are as far above me as he whom we buried
      today. I had to tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a few moments she could not find words to reply. She had never known
      him to humble himself like this. It was hard to reconcile him with the
      grim, pitiless man who had sat opposite her on that nightmare journey from
      London.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did hate you&mdash;bitterly,&rdquo; she said at last. &ldquo;I don't think I do so
      now. It is easy to say 'I forgive you,' but I don't quite know what it
      implies. As for one of us being higher than the other, you are a great
      physician, and I am just an ignorant girl with a miserable set of
      unregulated emotions&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You should thank God for them,&rdquo; he interrupted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They haven't brought me much happiness,&rdquo; she said, with a little shrug of
      her shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See, I am frank! No, I won't say I forgive, but I'll think kindly of you,
      Syl, I promise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is all I dare hope for,&rdquo; he said. And so the enmity came to an end.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the next two or three days, Sylvester was busy with his father's
      affairs. The will provided for a large sum to be paid to Usher, another to
      Roderick, while Sylvester was the residuary legatee, charged with a yearly
      allowance to Miss Lanyon and certain minor bequests. But after deducting
      the legacies to the Ushers, there was nothing left in the estate but
      Woodlands itself, and that was heavily mortgaged, and the mortgage had
      been bought up by Usher. Sylvester reviewed his own financial position.
    </p>
    <p>
      His professional income was fairly large, and showed every prospect of
      increasing year by year, but of capital he had little. Dorothy's future
      had to be provided for. Miss Lanyon must receive the amount specified in
      the will. Could he afford to pay the interest on the mortgage and keep up
      a large country house and grounds as well? He could not. Woodlands would
      have to go. The three thousand pounds which Roderick had fraudulently
      drawn from the estate would have made a considerable difference in
      Sylvester's calculations.
    </p>
    <p>
      From his father's books he discovered that this sum roughly represented
      the sale of certain stock a day or two before the cheque was forged, and
      lay at the bankers awaiting reinvestment. How did the knowledge of this
      reach Roderick? Sylvester was puzzled, for a man does not usually keep a
      balance of three or four thousand pounds to his credit account, and
      Roderick was too shrewd to run the risk of so large a cheque unless he
      knew there would be an adequate sum to meet it. Rightly he concluded that
      Mr. Usher had given his son the information. But whether Roderick was
      acquainted with the blackmailing secret he could not tell. An instinct of
      generosity, newly awakened, prompted the conjecture of Roderick's
      ignorance. On this assumption he arrived at what happened to be the
      correct solution: Roderick in desperate need of money had applied to
      Usher; the latter had refused; had suggested the forgery, knowing of the
      sale of stock, and had given him the cheque which he himself had once
      abstracted from Mr. Lanyon's cheque-book so as to meet any sudden
      emergency, at the same time assuring his son against any unpleasant risks
      on the discovery of the forgery. Roderick's silence on the point Sylvester
      could only put down to his credit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both Ella and Miss Lanyon were acquainted with the terms of the will,
      though neither as yet was informed of the financial condition of the
      estate. The large sums bequeathed to Usher and Roderick had astonished
      them. Sylvester explained vaguely that they were in payment of a great
      debt of gratitude which his father had incurred when Mr. Usher and himself
      were young men together in Australia. Miss Lanyon, who never questioned
      such statements, took refuge in her grief from further thoughts on the
      matter, like the gentle, simple lady she was. But Ella, with Sylvester's
      words in the churchyard fresh in her mind, scented a mystery. After the
      reading of the will, the subject was not openly mentioned by her or by
      Sylvester. Roderick's name stood between them. The silence was a restraint
      which each felt to be irksome. At last Ella, with a woman's greater moral
      courage, or perhaps with a woman's love of self-castigation, resolutely
      plunged into matters.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you think it impertinent of me if I asked you to let me discuss
      Uncle Matthew's will with you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had stopped him by the library door, as he was entering after
      breakfast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By no means,&rdquo; he replied courteously, holding the door open for her.
      &ldquo;Come in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What has happened to me during the last six months,&rdquo; she said, when they
      were seated, &ldquo;will remain with me as a memory all my life. I should like
      to know what to think about&mdash;Roderick.&rdquo; She got the name out bravely,
      after a second's hesitation. &ldquo;He really did what you accused him of?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He acknowledged it to me,&rdquo; replied Sylvester.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has he always been&mdash;what men call a scamp, or was this a sudden
      temptation?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was in a desperate plight. That I know. I can't say what he was
      before. I have had a bitter lesson in judging men. All my standards have
      fallen away, and Heaven knows whom I dare judge. One doesn't know what's
      resisted. Burns said that a hundred years ago. And one doesn't know what
      remorse follows. The human soul is an awful thing. Men are better than
      their deeds. There is good in Roderick. I believe it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And his father?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; he asked, startled. &ldquo;Your father's will,&mdash;all
      that money to those two.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I explained to Aunt Agatha.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was no explanation. From a hundred things I can remember now, I
      can't help feeling that there was force in the matter&mdash;oh, a horrible
      feeling&mdash;if it is as I suspect, you can understand&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I firmly believe Roderick to be innocent of any wrong of the sort.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;And his father?&rdquo; Sylvester rose and filled his
      pipe without speaking. It seemed odd to him that he felt no resentment at
      her questioning him. The chord in his temperament that once would have
      vibrated sharply and jarringly seemed to have snapped. He could only
      admire in a helpless way the strength of character that had carried her
      through so terrible an ordeal, her magnanimity, and the acuteness of her
      perception. But he filled his pipe with great deliberation, for to answer
      was difficult.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told you, Ella, I was powerless to judge any man,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Take my
      assurance as regards Roderick and forget it all. The answer to your
      question I have no right to give to any but one being in the world. Then
      it would be my duty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dorothy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Another.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Their eyes met for a moment. Hers lowered, and a faint spot of colour came
      into her cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand. Forgive me,&rdquo; she said. There was a slight pause. She rose
      to go. Suddenly Sylvester detained her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I may as well tell you what all the world will know soon. After paying
      these legacies there will be nothing left for the residuary legatee save
      Woodlands, and that is heavily mortgaged. I shall have to sell it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sell Woodlands!&rdquo; She looked at him aghast. &ldquo;Why, I thought Uncle Matthew
      was leaving you a small fortune. It was the dream of his life!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has left me, thank God, an infinitely greater inheritance,&rdquo; said
      Sylvester.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not question him, only looked at him blankly, dimly comprehending.
      Then she reverted to the more easily intelligible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But to sell Woodlands!&rdquo; she reiterated. &ldquo;Impossible! When we were tiny
      children, he used to talk of your living here after him. You must.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven't the money,&rdquo; he said sadly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I have. I'll buy it. I shall. You needn't laugh. Who in the wide
      world can prevent me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Ella,&rdquo; he said with a smile, &ldquo;how would that help matters? I
      could not live in your house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dorothy and Aunt Agatha could. You could rent it. There are many ways.
      Anyhow, Uncle Matthew would sooner have it in my hands than in a
      stranger's. I have made up my mind. It will be my first investment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And so as to have the last word, she swept across the room and retired.
      The swish of her skirts had hardly ceased to sound in Sylvester's ears
      when a servant came in with a letter. It bore no stamp, and was in
      Roderick's handwriting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Trotter from the White Hart brought it, sir,&rdquo; explained the servant.
    </p>
    <p>
      The letter ran:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     <i>Having received your solicitor's letter concerning the
     legacy under Mr. Lanyon's will, I came down last evening to
     see my father. In the course of conversation he revealed to
     me facts which have literally stunned me. I must see you or
     write to you. But as these things are best unwritten,
     perhaps in the utterly unprecedented circumstances you would
     be willing to bear the pain that such an interview might
     cause you, and make an appointment to meet me today. I would
     suggest this hotel. Perhaps I have little right to do so,
     but, I earnestly beseech you to believe in my good faith.

     Roderick Usher.</i>
</pre>
    <p>
      Sylvester read this letter, so uncharacteristic of the man as he had known
      him, with a recrudescence of implacable feeling. To meet him was hateful.
      The agony of the journey to Ayresford a week ago came upon him. He
      crumpled the letter tight in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was to wait for an answer, sir,&rdquo; hazarded the servant, after a time.
    </p>
    <p>
      The commonplace, as it often does, brought reaction. He scribbled a line,
      fixing the appointment at twelve.

    <p>
      He found Roderick pacing up and down the stiffly furnished and somewhat
      dingy private sitting-room of the White Hart Hotel. The two men brought
      suddenly face to face remained for a while in an embarrassed silence, each
      looking in the eyes of the other. For the first time Sylvester realised in
      all its significance the blood tie that bound them. This man was his
      brother. Grotesque and incongruous though it seemed, the fact was driven
      home to him as by some mighty blow. This man's mother was his mother,&mdash;the
      mother who had sung him to sleep as a little child, who had listened to
      his boyish confidence, who had been inwoven in all his early life, whose
      voice whose caress, whose fragrance, lingered vividly in all his senses,
      whose body and soul were unalienably <i>his</i>. A horrible jealousy
      seized him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Roderick, though point-device in blue serge suit and saffron-silk tie,
      looked aged and careworn. The lines under his eyes had deepened. He had
      lost flesh, and his cheeks were flabby. He was the first to break the
      silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It may be absurd for a man of forty to talk about his mother, but if I
      had had your advantages in that respect, I might have been a better man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Sylvester's jealousy vanished, and he remembered the wrong that had
      been done.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My father did all that a human soul could do to make atonement,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And mine did everything in his power to prevent it. Will you sit down?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Roderick motioned Sylvester to a chair, and sat down near him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't pretend to love my father. I never had reason to. I am a bad lot,
      I know, but compared to him, I am the incarnation of virtue. When I forged
      the cheque, I was given to understand for the first time that my father
      had some mysterious hold over Mr. Lanyon. But, as God hears me, I never
      dreamed until last night of the true nature of the case. Do you believe
      me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Sylvester; &ldquo;I believe you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; returned Roderick; &ldquo;now I know where I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He lit a cigarette, having offered his case to Sylvester, who declined.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is now in my power,&rdquo; said he, after enjoying the first two fragrant
      whiffs, &ldquo;to restore the money I stole from you. You observe I have the
      grace to use the naked expression. Will you accept it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said Sylvester. &ldquo;It is but just.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you think I would repay you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Frankly speaking, no.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And having heard my father's story last night, do you think I'll touch a
      penny of your father's money?&rdquo; he cried, bringing his hand with a thump on
      the round centre-table. &ldquo;My God! I would sooner die.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The balance above the three thousand is yours,&rdquo; said Sylvester. &ldquo;I cannot
      accept a gift from you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Roderick puffed violently at his cigarette, threw it away, and rose to his
      feet excitedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't touch it. I have been a damned villain, I know. I was hard put to
      it, and I worked upon a girl's emotions so that I could marry her for her
      money. Then, by Heaven, I began to love her, finished by loving her madly,
      with an insensate passion. To get her, I committed a cowardly crime. I
      broke my parole, as it were, with you. I deserve every epithet of
      dishonour as regards that which you like to heap upon me, but to carry on
      this horrible, hideous blackmail&mdash;by God, I can't do it. Last night
      has turned me into a moral man. I'll forswear sack and live cleanly for
      the rest of my life. I could vomit with disgust. It is <i>écourant</i>,&mdash;makes
      one's heart retch! Do you know what I've found out? You asked me once
      whether my father didn't make me an allowance. That put me on the track
      last night. I cross-questioned, found out that for years and years Mr.
      Lanyon, besides submitting to my fathers extortion, had given him £400 a
      year to be handed to me as an allowance; and I've never in my life
      received a penny of it, so help me God, never! Your father has made
      atonement, every atonement. I learn that he has been sucked dry, and that
      there is nothing left for you. It is I who now must make atonement for my
      father. Could blackmail be more abject than his? Consider for one ghastly
      moment the nature of it. In the name of charity, for the sake of what is
      left of my manhood, take back all this money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had delivered this harangue with his old fervour and declamatory
      gestures, and when he had ended he flung himself into an armchair and
      wiped his brow with his handkerchief. Suddenly he started again to his
      feet and seized a folded folio document lying on the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I've been down to Higginson the solicitor this morning,
      and executed a deed of gift, making the whole thing over to you, less the
      legacy duty. For Heaven's sake, take it and let me feel an honest man
      again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sylvester read through the document. Then he folded it up and put it in
      his pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The three thousand I'll take,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The remainder, with your
      permission, I'll give to the Prisoners' Aid Society; my father took a keen
      interest in it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anything, so long as I don't touch it,&rdquo; said Roderick, lighting another
      cigarette. &ldquo;Ha! Now I feel free, and can take up the threads of life
      again. By the way, when you go, think as charitably of my father as you
      can. I've done with him for ever and ever, but I've explained him to
      myself. He is a perfect type of the non-moral being, the instinctive
      criminal. There's a family history which you as a physician would find
      interesting. To me as a poor devil of an artist, it is a bogey which only
      walks abroad in the night of my mind. I suppose I have a share in the
      family taint, but as I hope never to propagate my species, it will die
      with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He rattled on in his vehement way, and once more Sylvester fell under the
      spell of his exuberant personality, preferring to listen than to speak.
      Roderick launched out into a forecast of his future. He would forswear
      sack, he repeated, and live cleanly, with Art for his chaste mistress. &ldquo;I
      got an idea for a picture, this morning, that is going to revolutionise my
      existence,&rdquo; said he. Sylvester's acceptance of the deed of gift was like
      the removal of a heavy stone that had held prisoner his elvish spirit. And
      the more he approached the Roderick of six months ago, the more did
      Sylvester wonder at the nature of the man. Yet his pocket held irrefutable
      proof of the man's sincerity. At last he rose and held out his hand.
      Roderick looked at him, and looked at the hand in astonishment; then he
      strode a pace forward and grasped it eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a good fellow to shake hands with me,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ring of genuine feeling touched Sylvester deeply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us bury the past,&rdquo; he replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On my side, God knows how willingly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And whether we are friends or not, we'll remember that the same mother
      bore us.&rdquo; Roderick bowed, his quick perception divining the cost at which
      the words were uttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall always remember it,&rdquo; he said soberly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He accompanied his visitor down the stairs to the front porch of the
      old-fashioned hotel. The men shook hands again. Roderick disappeared in
      the gloom of the corridor, and Sylvester turned to see, on the other side
      of the street, Ella, out on some small shopping errand, watching him in
      amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      He crossed the road and walked by her side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your question of this morning is answered,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, Syl,&rdquo; she replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps I shall be able to keep Woodlands, after all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was praying for it,&rdquo; she said significantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Two days afterwards Ella left for the south of France with Lady Milmo, and
      Sylvester returned to town to prepare his gloomy house for Dorothy's
      reception.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXII&mdash;A GLORIOUS WORLD
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>wo years passed
      and brought with them their changes, sudden and gradual. A few months
      after Matthew Lanyon's death, old Ebenezer Usher died of an apoplectic
      fit. Ruin was staring him in the face. Of all the moneys he had extorted
      only a few hundreds remained. Peter Vavasour &amp; Co. and others of their
      bucket-shop confraternity had sucked him dry as he had sucked Matthew.
      Indignation at the wickedness of mankind killed him and he went to his own
      place. His effects were sold, and the considerable sum that was realised&mdash;for
      his collections of china, postage stamps, and book plates were remarkably
      fine&mdash;was handed over by Roderick, still zealous to atone, to
      Sylvester, who paid it into the funds of the Prisoners' Aid Society. And
      this was the end of Ebenezer Usher. The grass grows over the grave wherein
      he lies, some twenty yards away from his enemy.
    </p>
    <p>
      No tombstone marks, or ever will mark, the spot. &ldquo;He is not the kind of
      man whose memory one cares to perpetuate,&rdquo; said his son.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Lanyon lived at Woodlands, where sometimes Ella and sometimes Dorothy
      stayed with her; and now and then for change of scene went Sylvester. He
      could not realise the old man's dream, and live there, devoting himself to
      research, but it comforted him to know that the house had not passed into
      alien hands. His own home in Weymouth Street was gladdened by a child's
      presence, and the spirit of its desolation departed. Instinctively he felt
      that it was too gloomy for a child, and with the pathetic helplessness of
      an inartistic man who had never concerned himself about such things, he
      took her with him to choose new wall papers, curtains, and rugs. Perhaps
      the result was incongruous, but at any rate it was bright, and pleased the
      choosers mightily.
    </p>
    <p>
      The effect of the great revolution in Sylvester's attitude to life
      gradually grew more apparent. The intense humanity of his profession won
      to his heart now that the barriers of ice were melted. The intellectual
      problem which it had been his duty to solve became the hurt to a suffering
      creature which it was his privilege to heal. A new tenderness softened his
      nature. The gift of speech came to him as by the miracle of the gift of
      tongues. To his great wonder, the society of ordinary kindly men and
      women, from which in a general way he had shrunk all his life through
      shyness and reserve, and which in positive misanthropy he had afterwards
      shunned, gradually appeared to him a sweet and pleasant thing, until he
      recognised it as a necessity in his existence. And old feelings, sweeter,
      sadder, infinitely deeper than of old, were reawakened.
    </p>
    <p>
      How it came about he knew not. When he had parted from Ella after his
      father's funeral, he did not love her. He had realised the irrevocable
      loss of a happiness that might have been, and that was all. Then on her
      return from the south of France late in the spring he had seen her and
      spoken with her, and she had been kind. A month afterwards he had seen her
      again, and once more six months after that,&mdash;for they rarely met. And
      then he knew that she was the one woman in the world for him, and that the
      love for which he had kissed her years ago was as moonlight unto the
      sunlight of his present love.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once more they had met, and he told her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can I love you when you have done so much to hurt me?&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't ask for your love,&rdquo; he urged.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do,&rdquo; she replied with a smile of wisdom. &ldquo;Don't deceive yourself,
      Syl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, I will make you love me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't speak like that,&rdquo; she said with a shiver. &ldquo;It is horrible to make a
      woman love. There is no woman made to love that does not repent it in
      shame and misery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you once did love me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have hurt me. Life has hurt me,&rdquo; she said gently. &ldquo;I don't mean to
      say that it was not partly my own fault, nor do I want to pose as an
      injured woman. But the fact remains, Syl, dear; and you must let time do
      what it can in the way of healing. If you care for me, see me a little
      oftener than you have done,&mdash;it will be good for both of us,&mdash;but
      don't speak of this again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I to go through a term of probation?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heaven forbid!&rdquo; said Ella.
    </p>
    <p>
      There the matter remained. They met more frequently, became fast friends,
      and Sylvester waited. And so the two years slipped by.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a hot August day, and Lady Milmo sat in the verandah of the little
      hotel at Vitznau at the foot of the Righi, with a novel open on her lap.
      Her eyes were fixed idly upon a little speck of a boat on the lake by
      whose sides rose rhythmically tiny silver flashes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don't you come <i>unexpectedly</i> upon us here?&rdquo; she had written to
      Sylvester, of whose arrival in Zermatt a chance-met wandering acquaintance
      had told her. &ldquo;You will find the Righi <i>much</i> more satisfactory than
      that silly Jungfrau. And you will find two people quite disposed to be
      very kind to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So Sylvester had left his ice-axes and ropes and mountaineering boots at
      Zermatt, and had flown on the wings of hope to Vitznau, and there he was
      with Ella in the little boat on the lake.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon an approaching steamboat from Lucerne hid the tiny speck from Lady
      Milmo's view,-and gradually drew near. The inmates of the hotel came on to
      the verandah to watch the landing of the passengers, the morning's
      excitement. The gangway was thrust forward from the little jetty, and the
      crowd streamed ashore,&mdash;fresh English girls in straw hats,
      substantial fathers, anxious, lonely ladies with profusion of
      hand-baggage, Germans girt with satchel and vasculum, pacing sultanesquely
      in front of their womenkind, English parsons, happy and perspiring,&mdash;all
      amidst a sort of tangled undergrowth of umbrellas, and straps, and sticks,
      and alpenstocks purchased in Lucerne with the burnt-in names of
      inaccessible peaks circling round them. Some proceeded at once to the tiny
      railway station where the grotesquely slanting train awaited them. Others
      poured on to the verandah and took possession of the hotel. The gong for
      <i>dejeuner</i> sounded. Lady Milmo looked anxiously at her speck, which
      had become visible again, and then at her watch. The occupants of the boat
      gave no sign of returning shorewards. They would be late for <i>table
      d'hôte</i>. Lady Milmo waved her pocket-handkerchief until she was the
      last person on the verandah, and then she went into the <i>salle-a-manger</i>
      alone, feeling somewhat injured.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, the two in the boat had been rowing idly over the lake. Ella
      lay back on the cushions of the stern with half-closed eyes, while
      Sylvester sculled lazily. She had been very glad to see him when he
      arrived the evening before, and her heart had given him a little unbidden
      throb of welcome. His altered attitude towards her, as well as dim gleams
      of revelation of some fundamental change within him, had caused her to
      forget, or at least look back unresentfully upon old wrongs. At times an
      inflection of the voice, a sudden gentleness of manner, brought his father
      vividly back to her. It seemed as if, by some strange metempsychosis, the
      old man's spirit had entered into the son, and was gradually unfolding. He
      was still the worthiest man she knew. She lived her old life amid the
      jargon of culture in her aunt's house, and it wearied her, and she longed
      for something nobler. In Sylvester she found at least reality. She beheld
      him a sane, sincere, strong man, around whose life was gathered an
      indeterminate pathos.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sun shone bright from a deep blue sky flecked here and there with an
      infinitely distant wisp of cirrus. The tiny promontories jutted out their
      green into the lake. Far away rose the glittering white snow-peaks, and
      close at hand the mass of the Righi with white specks of habitations
      nestling in its sides. The water plashed pleasantly against the side of
      the boat. Ella murmured of the loveliness around.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The day seems to have got into my heart,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;If you looked into
      it, you would see everything as in a camera. I wish it would last.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why shouldn't it?&rdquo; asked Sylvester, leaning on his sculls.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are going away to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is a way in which I at least could keep this in my heart for ever,&rdquo;
       said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would that could be a way for me too,&rdquo; she murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not, dear? I have waited for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked round upon the tremulous beauty of sky and lake and mountain
      with a wistful sense of its transience. Her heart was very womanly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be a way for me, if there were not something between us, Syl,&rdquo;
       she answered,&mdash;&ldquo;something that keeps us apart. I don't know what it
      is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I could remove it&mdash;?&rdquo; he began.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their eyes met. He suddenly took to his oars and began to pull with
      vigorous strokes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are going to land,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were silent untilThey were silent until they had reached the foot of one of the little
      promontories. Then, finding a convenient landing-place, he clambered out
      and helped her ashore.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us sit down, dear,&rdquo; he said, when he had made fast the boat. &ldquo;I have
      a great deal to tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And there in the cool shade of the pine-trees, with the quivering
      noon-tide haze between them and the great stretch of lake, he told her all
      his story: of Constance and Leroux, of the awful frost that had frozen his
      heart, of his father and the elder Usher, of his own lack of right to the
      name he bore, of his father's death-bed. He spoke continuously in an
      earnest undertone, although their solitude was broken only by the twitter
      of birds and the soft whirring of summer insects. Ella, sitting a little
      way apart, kept silent and never stirred save to look up at him from time
      to time with piteous wonder in her eyes. And as the old man's tragedy was
      unfolded before her, the tears brimmed over and fell down her cheeks. Thus
      all the dark places were made light to her. The man's soul was revealed.
      She felt humbled, of small account, as though admitted unworthy into some
      holy place of sacred things, where sin and suffering were washed away by a
      divine pity. He ended abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's all the story,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;you must judge us both as you think
      best.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a moment she sat silent, as her heart was too full for speech; but her
      hand, that had some while since found its way into his, gave him a soft
      sign of sympathy. At last words came.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand all, Syl,&mdash;both you and him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That means forgiving all.&rdquo;

      There was a silence. Their souls held communion, the barrier between them
      being broken down. We have passed through pain and sorrow, ran the mutual
      message, and our hearts have been made exceeding pitiful, and love at last
      dwells therein. And for a season time stood still.

      Ella looked through the mist of her tears at the splendour of the day.
      Suddenly the mist cleared, and the splendour was eclipsed by the dawning
      of a newer glory. Sylvester saw it in her eyes. With a cry of passionate
      joy he flung his arms around her, and she gave her life to him utterly.

      Once he paused, and their eyes drank deep of each other. At length she
      smiled.

      &ldquo;The world is a glorious place,&rdquo; she said.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
